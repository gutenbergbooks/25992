<p>In submitting this volume to the public under your Lordship&rsquo;s
auspices, I avail myself of the opportunity thus afforded me of
expressing the deep sense which I entertain of the friendship and
kindness with which your Lordship has so long honoured me.</p>

<p>Although in these days, when Science constitutes the power and wealth of
nations, and encircles the domestic hearth with its most substantial
comforts, there is no risk of its votaries being either persecuted or
neglected, yet the countenance of those to whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Providence has given rank and station will ever be one of the most
powerful incitements to scientific enterprise, as well as one of its
most legitimate rewards. Next to the satisfaction of cultivating
Science, and thus laying up the only earthly treasure which we can carry
along with us into a better state, is that of having encouraged and
assisted others in the same beneficent labours. That your Lordship may
long continue to enjoy these sources of happiness is the earnest prayer
of,</p>

<p>The history of the life and labours of Galileo is pregnant with a
peculiar interest to the general reader, as well as to the philosopher.
His brilliant discoveries, the man of science regards as his peculiar
property; the means by which they were made, and the development of his
intellectual character, belong to the logician and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to the philosopher; but the triumphs and the reverses of his eventful
life must be claimed for our common nature, as a source of more than
ordinary instruction.</p>

<p>The lengthened career which Providence assigned to Galileo was filled up
throughout its rugged outline with events even of dramatic interest. But
though it was emblazoned with achievements of transcendent magnitude,
yet his noblest discoveries were the derision of his contemporaries, and
were even denounced as crimes which merited the vengeance of Heaven.
Though he was the idol of his friends, and the favoured companion of
princes, yet he afterwards became the victim of persecution, and spent
some of his last hours within the walls of a prison; and though the
Almighty granted him, as it were, a new sight to descry unknown worlds
in the obscurity of space, yet the eyes which were allowed to witness
such wonders, were themselves doomed to be closed in darkness.</p>

<p>Such were the lights and shadows in which history delineates</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The starry Galileo with his woes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class='noin'><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
But, however powerful be their contrasts, they are not unusual in their
proportions. The balance which has been struck between his days of good
and evil, is that which regulates the lot of man, whether we study it in
the despotic sway of the autocrat, in the peaceful inquiries of the
philosopher, or in the humbler toils of ordinary life.</p>

<p>Galileo Galilei was born at Pisa, on the 15th of February, 1564, and was
the eldest of a family of three sons and three daughters. Under the name
of Bonajuti, his noble ancestors had filled high offices at Florence;
but about the middle of the 14th century they seem to have abandoned
this surname for that of Galileo. Vincenzo Galilei, our author&rsquo;s
father, was himself a philosopher of no mean powers; and though his
talents seem to have been exercised only in the composition of treatises
on the theory and practice of music, yet he appears to have anticipated
even his son in a just estimate of the philosophy of the age, and in a
distinct perception of the true method of investigating
truth.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
The early years of Galileo were, like those of almost all great
experimental philosophers, spent in the construction of instruments and
pieces of machinery, which were calculated chiefly to amuse himself and
his schoolfellows. This employment of his hands, however, did not
interfere with his regular studies; and though, from the straitened
circumstances of his father, he was educated under considerable
disadvantages, yet he acquired the elements of classical literature, and
was initiated into all the learning of the times. Music, drawing, and
painting were the occupations of his leisure hours; and such was his
proficiency in these arts, that he was reckoned a skilful performer on
several musical instruments, especially the lute; and his knowledge of
pictures was held in great esteem by some of the best artists of his
day.</p>

<p>Galileo seems to have been desirous of following the profession of a
painter: but his father had observed decided indications of early
genius; and, though by no means able to afford it, he resolved to send
him to the university to pursue the study of medicine. He accordingly
enrolled himself as a scholar in arts at the university of Pisa, on the
5th of November, 1581,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and pursued his medical studies under the celebrated botanist Andrew
C&aelig;salpinus, who filled the chair of medicine from 1567 to 1592.</p>

<p>In order to study the principles of music and drawing, Galileo found it
necessary to acquire some knowledge of geometry. His father seems to
have foreseen the consequences of following this new pursuit, and though
he did not prohibit him from reading Euclid under Ostilio Ricci, one of
the professors at Pisa, yet he watched his progress with the utmost
jealousy, and had resolved that it should not interfere with his medical
studies. The demonstrations, however, of the Greek mathematician had too
many charms for the ardent mind of Galileo. His whole attention was
engrossed with the new truths which burst upon his understanding; and
after many fruitless attempts to check his ardour and direct his
thoughts to professional objects, his father was obliged to surrender
his parental control, and allow the fullest scope to the genius of his
son.</p>

<p>From the elementary works of geometry, Galileo passed to the writings of
Archimedes; and while he was studying the hydrostatical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
treatise<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
of the Syracusan philosopher, he wrote his essay on the hydrostatical
balance,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
in which he describes the construction of the instrument, and the method
by which Archimedes detected the fraud committed by the jeweller in the
composition of Hiero&rsquo;s crown. This work gained for its author the
esteem of Guido Ubaldi, who had distinguished himself by his mechanical
and mathematical acquirements, and who engaged his young friend to
investigate the subject of the centre of gravity in solid bodies. The
treatise on this subject, which Galileo presented to his patron, proved
the source of his future success in life.</p>

<p>Through the Cardinal del Monte, the brother-in-law of Ubaldi, the
reigning Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand de Medici was made acquainted with
the merits of our young philosopher; and, in 1589, he was appointed
lecturer on mathematics at Pisa. As the salary, however, attached to
this office was only sixty crowns, he was compelled to enlarge this
inadequate income by the additional occupation of private teaching,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and thus to encroach upon the leisure which he was anxious to devote to
science.</p>

<p>With this moderate competency, Galileo commenced his philosophical
career. At the early age of eighteen, when he had entered the
university, his innate antipathy to the Aristotelian philosophy began to
display itself. This feeling was strengthened by his earliest inquiries;
and upon his establishment at Pisa he seems to have regarded the
doctrines of Aristotle as the intellectual prey which, in his chace of
glory, he was destined to pursue. Nizzoli, who flourished near the
beginning of the sixteenth century, and Giordano Bruno, who was burned
at Rome in 1600, led the way in this daring pursuit; but it was reserved
for Galileo to track the Thracian boar through its native thickets, and,
at the risk of his own life, to strangle it in its den.</p>

<p>With the resolution of submitting every opinion to the test of
experiment, Galileo&rsquo;s first inquiries at Pisa were directed to the
mechanical doctrines of Aristotle. Their incorrectness and absurdity
soon became apparent; and with a zeal, perhaps, bordering on
indiscretion, he denounced them to his pupils with an ardour of manner
and of expression proportioned to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
own conviction of the truth. The detection of long-established errors is
apt to inspire the young philosopher with an exultation which reason
condemns. The feeling of triumph is apt to clothe itself in the language
of asperity; and the abettor of erroneous opinions is treated as a
species of enemy to science. Like the soldier who fleshes his first
spear in battle, the philosopher is apt to leave the stain of cruelty on
his early achievements. It is only from age and experience, indeed, that
we can expect the discretion of valour, whether it is called forth in
controversy or in battle. Galileo seems to have waged this stern warfare
against the followers of Aristotle; and such was the exasperation which
was excited by his reiterated and successful attacks, that he was
assailed, during the rest of his life, with a degree of rancour which
seldom originates in a mere difference of opinion. Forgetting that all
knowledge is progressive, and that the errors of one generation call
forth the comments, and are replaced by the discoveries, of the next,
Galileo did not anticipate that his own speculations and incompleted
labours might one day provoke unmitigated censure; and he therefore
failed in making allowance for the prejudices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and ignorance of his opponents. He who enjoys the proud lot of taking a
position in advance of his age, need not wonder that his less gifted
contemporaries are left behind. Men are not necessarily obstinate
because they cleave to deeply rooted and venerable errors, nor are they
absolutely dull when they are long in understanding and slow in
embracing newly discovered truths.</p>

<p>It was one of the axioms of the Aristotelian mechanics, that the heavier
of two falling bodies would reach the ground sooner than the other, and
that their velocities would be proportional to their weights. Galileo
attacked the arguments by which this opinion was supported; and when he
found his reasoning ineffectual, he appealed to direct experiment. He
maintained, that all bodies would fall through the same height in the
same time, if they were not unequally retarded by the resistance of the
air: and though he performed the experiment with the most satisfactory
results, by letting heavy bodies fall from the leaning tower of Pisa,
yet the Aristotelians, who with their own eyes saw the unequal weights
strike the ground at the same instant, ascribed the effect to some
unknown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
cause, and preferred the decision of their master to that of nature
herself.</p>

<p>Galileo could not brook this opposition to his discoveries; nor could
the Aristotelians tolerate the rebukes of their young instructor. The
two parties were, consequently, marshalled in hostile array; when,
fortunately for both, an event occurred, which placed them beyond the
reach of danger. Don Giovanni de Medici, a natural son of Cosmo, had
proposed a method of clearing out the harbour of Leghorn. Galileo, whose
opinion was requested, gave such an unfavourable report upon it, that
the disappointed inventor directed against him all the force of his
malice. It was an easy task to concentrate the malignity of his enemies
at Pisa; and so effectually was this accomplished, that Galileo resolved
to accept another professorship, to which he had been previously
invited.</p>

<p>The chair of mathematics in the university of Padua having been vacant
for five years, the republic of Venice had resolved to fill it up; and,
on the recommendation of Guido Ubaldi, Galileo was appointed to it, in
1592, for a period of six years.</p>

<p>Previous to this event, Galileo had lost his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
father, who died, in 1591, at an advanced age. As he was the eldest son,
the support of the family naturally devolved upon him; and this sacred
obligation must have increased his anxiety to better his circumstances,
and therefore added to his other inducements to quit Pisa. In September
1592, he removed to Padua, where he had a salary of only 180 florins,
and where he was again obliged to add to his income by the labours of
tuition. Notwithstanding this fruitless occupation of his time, he
appears to have found leisure for composing several of his works, and
completing various inventions, which will be afterwards described. His
manuscripts were circulated privately among his friends and pupils; but
some of them strayed beyond this sacred limit, and found their way into
the hands of persons, who did not scruple to claim and publish, as their
own, the discoveries and inventions which they contained.</p>

<p>It is not easy to ascertain the exact time when Galileo became a convert
to the doctrines of Copernicus, or the particular circumstances under
which he was led to adopt them. It is stated by Gerard Voss, that a
public lecture of M&oelig;stlin, the instructor of Kepler, was the
means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of making Galileo acquainted with the true system of the universe. This
assertion, however, is by no means probable; and it has been ably shown,
by the latest biographer of Galileo,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
that, in his dialogues on the Copernican system, our author gives the
true account of his own conversion. This passage is so interesting, that
we shall give it entire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot omit this opportunity of relating to you what happened
to myself at the time when this opinion (the Copernican system) began to
be discussed. I was then a very young man, and had scarcely finished my
course of philosophy, which other occupations obliged me to leave off,
when there arrived in this country, from Rostoch, a foreigner, whose
name, I believe, was Christian Vurstisius (Wurteisen), a follower of
Copernicus. This person delivered, on this subject, two or three
lectures in a certain academy, and to a crowded audience. Believing that
several were attracted more by the novelty of the subject than by any
other cause, and being firmly persuaded that this opinion was a piece of
solemn folly, I was unwilling to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
be present. Upon interrogating, however, some of those who were there, I
found that they all made it a subject of merriment, with the exception
of one, who assured me that it was not a thing wholly ridiculous. As I
considered this individual to be both prudent and circumspect, I
repented that I had not attended the lectures; and, whenever I met any
of the followers of Copernicus, I began to inquire if they had always
been of the same opinion. I found that there was not one of them who did
not declare that he had long maintained the very opposite opinions, and
had not gone over to the new doctrines till he was driven by the force
of argument. I next examined them one by one, to see if they were
masters of the arguments on the opposite side; and such was the
readiness of their answers, that I was satisfied they had not taken up
this opinion from ignorance or vanity. On the other hand, whenever I
interrogated the Peripatetics and the Ptolemeans&mdash;and, out of
curiosity, I have interrogated not a few&mdash;respecting their perusal
of Copernicus&rsquo;s work, I perceived that there were few who had seen
the book, and not one who understood it. Nor have I omitted to
inquire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
among the followers of the Peripatetic doctrines, if any of them had
ever stood on the opposite side; and the result was, that there was not
one. Considering, then, that nobody followed the Copernican doctrine,
who had not previously held the contrary opinion, and who was not well
acquainted with the arguments of Aristotle and Ptolemy; while, on the
other hand, nobody followed Ptolemy and Aristotle, who had before
adhered to Copernicus, and had gone over from him into the camp of
Aristotle;&mdash;weighing, I say, these things, I began to believe that,
if any one who rejects an opinion which he has imbibed with his milk,
and which has been embraced by an infinite number, shall take up an
opinion held only by a few, condemned by all the schools, and really
regarded as a great paradox, it cannot be doubted that he must have been
induced, not to say driven, to embrace it by the most cogent arguments.
On this account I have become very curious to penetrate to the very
bottom of the subject.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It appears, on the testimony of Galileo himself, that he taught the
Ptolemaic system, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
compliance with the popular feeling, after he had convinced himself of
the truth of the Copernican doctrines. In the treatise on the sphere,
indeed, which bears his name,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and which must have been written soon after he went to Padua, and
subsequently to 1592, the stability of the earth, and the motion of the
sun, are supported by the very arguments which Galileo afterwards
ridiculed; but we have no means of determining whether or not he had
then adopted the true system of the universe. Although he might have
taught the Ptolemaic system in his lectures after he had convinced
himself of its falsehood, yet it is not likely that he would go so far
as to publish to the world, as true, the very doctrines which he
despised. In a letter to Kepler, dated in 1597, he distinctly states
that he <i>had, many years ago, adopted the opinions of Copernicus</i>; but
that <i>he had not yet dared to publish his arguments in favour of them,
and his refutation of the opposite opinions</i>. These facts would leave us
to place Galileo&rsquo;s conversion somewhere between 1593 and
1597,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
although <i>many</i> years cannot be said to have elapsed between these two
dates.</p>

<p>At this early period of Galileo&rsquo;s life, in the year 1593, he met
with an accident which had nearly proved fatal. A party at Padua, of
which he was one, were enjoying, at an open window, a current of air,
which was artificially cooled by a fall of water. Galileo unfortunately
fell asleep under its influence; and so powerful was its effect upon his
robust constitution, that he contracted a severe chronic disorder,
accompanied with acute pains in his body, and loss of sleep and
appetite, which attacked him at intervals during the rest of his life.
Others of the party suffered still more severely, and perished by their
own rashness.</p>

<p>Galileo&rsquo;s reputation was now widely extended over Europe. The
Archduke Ferdinand (afterwards Emperor of Germany), the Landgrave of
Hesse, and the Princes of Alsace and Mantua, honoured his lectures with
their presence; and Prince Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden also received
instructions from him in mathematics, during his sojourn in Italy.</p>

<p>When Galileo had completed the first period of his engagement at Padua,
he was re-elected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
for other six years, with an increased salary of 320 florins. This
liberal addition to his income is ascribed by Fabbroni to the malice of
one of his enemies, who informed the Senate that Galileo was living in
illicit intercourse with Marina Gamba. Without inquiring into the truth
of the accusation, the Senate is said to have replied, that if &ldquo;he
had a family to support, he had the more need of an increased
salary.&rdquo; It is more likely that the liberality of the republic had
been called forth by the high reputation of their professor, and that
the terms of their reply were intended only to rebuke the malignity of
the informer. The mode of expression would seem to indicate that one or
more of Galileo&rsquo;s children had been born previous to his
re-election in 1598; but as this is scarcely consistent with other
facts, we are disposed to doubt the authenticity of Fabbroni&rsquo;s
anecdote.</p>

<p>The new star which attracted the notice of astronomers in 1604, excited
the particular attention of Galileo. The observations which he made upon
it, and the speculations which they suggested, formed the subject of
three lectures, the beginning of the first of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
only has reached our times. From the absence of parallax, he proved that
the common hypothesis of its being a meteor was erroneous, and that,
like the fixed stars, it was situated far beyond the bounds of our own
system. The popularity of the subject attracted crowds to his
lecture-room; and Galileo had the boldness to reproach his hearers for
taking so deep an interest in a temporary phenomenon, while they
overlooked the wonders of creation which were daily presented to their
view.</p>

<p>In the year 1606, Galileo was again appointed to the professorship at
Padua, with an augmented stipend of 520 florins. His popularity had now
risen so high, that his audience could not be accommodated in his
lecture-room; and even when he had assembled them in the school of
medicine, which contained 1000 persons, he was frequently obliged to
adjourn to the open air.</p>

<p>Among the variety of pursuits which occupied his attention, was the
examination of the properties of the loadstone. In 1607, he commenced
his experiments; but, with the exception of a method of arming
loadstones, which, according to the report of Sir Kenelm Digby,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
enabled them to carry twice as much weight as before, he does not seem
to have made any additions to our knowledge of magnetism. He appears to
have studied with care the admirable work of our countryman, Dr Gilbert,
&ldquo;De Magnete,&rdquo; which was published in 1600; and he recognised
in the experiments and reasonings of the English philosopher the
principles of that method of investigating truth which he had himself
adopted. Gilbert died in 1603, in the 63d year of his age, and probably
never read the fine compliment which was paid to him by the Italian
philosopher&mdash;&ldquo;I extremely praise, admire, and envy this
author.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter we have brought down the history of
Galileo&rsquo;s labours to that auspicious year in which he first
directed the telescope to the heavens. No sooner was that noble
instrument placed in his hands, than Providence released him from his
professional toils, and supplied him with the fullest leisure and the
amplest means for pursuing and completing the grandest discoveries.</p>

<p>Although he had quitted the service and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
domains of his munificent patron, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, yet he
maintained his connection with the family, by visiting Florence during
his academic vacations, and giving mathematical instruction to the
younger branches of that distinguished house. Cosmo, who had been one of
his pupils, now succeeded his father Ferdinand; and having his mind
early imbued with a love of knowledge, which had become hereditary in
his family, he felt that the residence of Galileo within his dominions,
and still more his introduction into his household, would do honour to
their common country, and reflect a lustre upon his own name. In the
year 1609, accordingly, Cosmo made proposals to Galileo to return to his
original situation at Pisa. These overtures were gratefully received;
and in the arrangements which Galileo on this occasion suggested, as
well as in the manner in which they were urged, we obtain some insight
into his temper and character. He informs the correspondent through whom
Cosmo&rsquo;s offer was conveyed, that his salary of 520 florins at
Padua would be increased to as many crowns at his re-election, and that
he could enlarge his income to any extent he pleased, by giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
private lectures and receiving pupils. His public duties, he stated,
occupied him only sixty half-hours in the year; but his studies suffered
such interruptions from his domestic pupils and private lectures, that
his most ardent wish was to be relieved from them, in order that he
might have sufficient rest and leisure, before the close of his life, to
finish and publish those great works which he had projected. In the
event, therefore, of his returning to Pisa, he hoped that it would be
the first object of his serene highness to give him leisure to complete
his works without the drudgery of lecturing. He expresses his anxiety to
gain his bread by his writings, and he promises to dedicate them to his
serene master. He enumerates, among these books, two on the system of
the universe, three on local motion, three books of mechanics, two on
the demonstration of principles, and one of problems; besides treatises
on sound and speech, on light and colours, on the tides, on the
composition of continuous quantity, on the motions of animals, and on
the military art. On the subject of his salary, he makes the following
curious observations:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say nothing,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;on the amount<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of my salary; being convinced that, as I am to live upon it, the
graciousness of his highness would not deprive me of any of those
comforts, of which, however, I feel the want of less than many others;
and, therefore, I say nothing more on the subject. Finally, on the title
and profession of my service, I should wish that, to the title of
mathematician, his highness would add that of philosopher, as I profess
to have studied a greater number of years in philosophy, than months in
pure mathematics; and how I have profited by it, and if I can or ought
to deserve this title, I may let their highnesses see, as often as it
shall please them to give me an opportunity of discussing such subjects
in their presence with those who are most esteemed in this
knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the progress of this negotiation, Galileo went to Venice, on a
visit to a friend, in the month of April or May 1609. Here he learned,
from common rumour, that a Dutchman had presented to prince Maurice of
Nassau an optical instrument, which possessed the singular property of
causing distant objects to appear nearer the observer. This Dutchman was
Hans or John Lippershey, who, as has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
been clearly proved by the late Professor Moll of Utrecht,<a
name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
was in the possession of a telescope made by himself so early as 2d
October 1608. A few days afterwards, the truth of this report was
confirmed by a letter which Galileo received from James Badorere at
Paris, and he immediately applied himself to the consideration of the
subject. On the first night after his return to Padua, he found, in the
doctrines of refraction, the principle which he sought. He placed at the
ends of a leaden tube two spectacle glasses, both of which were plain on
one side, while one of them had its other side convex, and the other its
second side concave, and having applied his eye to the concave glass, he
saw objects pretty large and pretty near him. This little instrument,
which magnified only three times, he carried in triumph to Venice, where
it excited the most intense interest. Crowds of the principal citizens
flocked to his house to see the magical toy; and after nearly a month
had been spent in gratifying this epidemical curiosity, Galileo was led
to understand from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Leonardo Deodati, the Doge of Venice, that the senate would be highly
gratified by obtaining possession of so extraordinary an instrument.
Galileo instantly complied with the wishes of his patrons, who
acknowledged the present by a mandate conferring upon him for life his
professorship at Padua, and generously raising his salary from 520 to
1000 florins.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Although we cannot doubt the veracity of Galileo, when he affirms that
he had never seen any of the Dutch telescopes, yet it is expressly
stated by Fuccarius, that one of these instruments had at this time been
brought to Florence; and Sirturus assures us that a Frenchman, calling
himself a partner of the Dutch inventor, came to Milan in May 1609, and
offered a telescope to the Count de Fuentes. In a letter from Lorenzo
Pignoria to Paolo Gualdo, dated from Padua, on the 31st of August 1609,
it is expressly said, that, at the re-election of the professors,
Galileo had contrived to obtain 1000 florins for life, which was alleged
to be on account of an eye-glass like the one which was sent from
Flanders to the Cardinal Borghese.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
In a memoir so brief and general as the present, it would be out of
place to discuss the history of this extraordinary invention. We have no
hesitation in asserting that a method of magnifying distant objects was
known to Baptista Porta and others; but it seems to be equally certain
that an <i>instrument</i> for producing these effects was first constructed
in Holland, and that it was from that kingdom that Galileo derived the
knowledge of its existence. In considering the contending claims, which
have been urged with all the ardour and partiality of national feeling,
it has been generally overlooked, <i>that a single convex lens</i>, whose
focal length exceeds the distance at which we examine minute objects,
performs the part of a telescope, when an eye, placed behind it, sees
distinctly the inverted image which it forms. A lens, twenty feet in
focal length, will in this manner magnify twenty times; and it was by
the same principle that Sir William Herschel discovered a new satellite
of Saturn, by using only the mirror of his forty-feet telescope. The
instrument presented to Prince Maurice, and which the Marquis Spinola
found in the shop of John Lippershey, the spectacle maker of Middleburg,
must have been an astronomical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
telescope consisting of two convex lenses. Upon this supposition, it
differed from that which Galileo constructed; and the Italian
philosopher will be justly entitled to the honour of having invented
that form of the telescope which still bears his name, while we must
accord to the Dutch optician the honour of having previously invented
the astronomical telescope.</p>

<p>The interest which the exhibition of the telescope excited at Venice did
not soon subside: Sirturi<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
describes it as amounting almost to phrensy. When he himself had
succeeded in making one of these instruments, he ascended the tower of
St Mark, where he might use it without molestation. He was recognised,
however, by a crowd in the street; and such was the eagerness of their
curiosity, that they took possession of the wondrous tube, and detained
the impatient philosopher for several hours, till they had successively
witnessed its effects. Desirous of obtaining the same gratification for
their friends, they endeavoured to learn the name of the inn at which he
lodged; but Sirturi fortunately overheard their inquiries, and quitted
Venice early next morning, in order to avoid a second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
visitation of this new school of philosophers. The opticians speedily
availed themselves of the new instrument. Galileo&rsquo;s tube,&mdash;or
the double eye-glass, or the cylinder, or the trunk, as it was then
called, for Demisiano had not yet given it the appellation of
<i>telescope</i>,&mdash;was manufactured in great quantities, and in a very
superior manner. The instruments were purchased merely as philosophical
toys, and were carried by travellers into every corner of Europe.</p>

<p>The art of grinding and polishing lenses was at this time very
imperfect. Galileo, and those whom he instructed, were alone capable of
making tolerable instruments. It appears, from the testimony of Gassendi
and G&aelig;rtner, that, in 1634, a good telescope could not be procured in
Paris, Venice, or Amsterdam; and that, even in 1637, there was not one
in Holland which could shew Jupiter&rsquo;s disc well defined.</p>

<p>After Galileo had completed his first instrument, which magnified only
<i>three</i> times, he executed a larger and a better one, with a power of
about <i>eight</i>. &ldquo;At length,&rdquo; as he himself remarks,
&ldquo;sparing neither labour nor expense,&rdquo; he constructed an
instrument so excellent, that it bore a magnifying power of more than
<i>thirty</i> times.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
The first celestial object to which Galileo applied his telescope was
the moon, which, to use his own words, appeared as near as if it had
been distant only two semidiameters of the earth. He then directed it to
the planets and the fixed stars, which he frequently observed with
&ldquo;incredible delight.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The observations which he made upon the moon possessed a high degree of
interest. The general resemblance of its surface to that of our own
globe naturally fixed his attention; and he was soon able to trace, in
almost every part of the lunar disc, ranges of mountains, deep hollows,
and other inequalities, which reverberated from their summits and
margins the rays of the rising sun, while the intervening hollows were
still buried in darkness. The dark and luminous spaces he regarded as
indicating seas and continents, which reflected, in different degrees,
the incidental light of the sun; and he ascribed the phosphorescence, as
it has been improperly called, or the secondary light, which is seen on
the dark limb of the moon in her first and last quarters, to the
reflection of the sun&rsquo;s light from the earth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
These discoveries were ill received by the followers of Aristotle.
According to their preconceived opinions, the moon was perfectly
spherical, and absolutely smooth; and to cover it with mountains, and
scoop it out into valleys, was an act of impiety which defaced the
regular forms which Nature herself had imprinted. It was in vain that
Galileo appealed to the evidence of observation, and to the actual
surface of our own globe. The very irregularities on the moon were, in
his opinion, the proof of divine wisdom; and had its surface been
absolutely smooth, it would have been &ldquo;but a vast unblessed
desert, void of animals, of plants, of cities, and of men&mdash;the abode of
silence and inaction&mdash;senseless, lifeless, soulless, and stripped of all
those ornaments which now render it so varied and so beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In examining the fixed stars, and comparing them with the planets,
Galileo observed a remarkable difference in the appearance of their
discs. All the planets appeared with round globular discs like the moon;
whereas the fixed stars never exhibited any disc at all, but resembled
lucid points sending forth twinkling rays. Stars of all magnitudes he
found to have the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
appearance; those of the fifth and sixth magnitude having the same
character, when seen through a telescope, as Sirius, the largest of the
stars, when seen by the naked eye. Upon directing his telescope to
nebul&aelig; and clusters of stars, he was delighted to find that they
consisted of great numbers of stars which could not be recognised by
unassisted vision. He counted no fewer than <i>forty</i> in the cluster
called the <i>Pleiades</i>, or <i>Seven Stars</i>; and he has given us drawings of
this constellation, as well as of the belt and sword of Orion, and of
the nebula of Pr&aelig;sepe. In the great nebula of the Milky Way, he
descried crowds of minute stars; and he concluded that this singular
portion of the heavens derived its whiteness from still smaller stars,
which his telescope was unable to separate.</p>

<p>Important and interesting as these discoveries were, they were thrown
into the shade by those to which he was led during an accurate
examination of the planets with a more powerful telescope. On the 7th of
January 1610, at one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when he directed his
telescope to Jupiter, he observed three stars near the body of the
planet, two being to the east and one to the west of him. They were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
all in a straight line, and parallel to the ecliptic, and appeared
brighter than other stars of the same magnitude. Believing them to be
fixed stars, he paid no great attention to their distances from Jupiter
and from one another. On the 8th of January, however, when, from some
cause or other,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
he had been led to observe the stars again, he found a very different
arrangement of them: all the three were on the west side of Jupiter,
<i>nearer one another than before</i>, and almost at equal distances. Though
he had not turned his attention to the extraordinary fact of the mutual
approach of the stars, yet he began to consider how Jupiter could be
found to the east of the three stars, when but the day before he had
been to the west of two of them. The only explanation which he could
give of this fact was, that the motion of Jupiter was <i>direct</i>, contrary
to astronomical calculations, and that he had got before these two stars
by his own motion.</p>

<p>In this dilemma between the testimony of his senses and the results of
calculation, he waited for the following night with the utmost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
anxiety; but his hopes were disappointed, for the heavens were wholly
veiled in clouds. On the 10th, two only of the stars appeared, and both
on the east of the planet. As it was obviously impossible that Jupiter
could have advanced from west to east on the 8th of January, and from
east to west on the 10th, Galileo was forced to conclude that the
phenomenon which he had observed arose from the motion of the stars, and
he set himself to observe diligently their change of place. On the 11th,
there were still only two stars, and both to the east of Jupiter; but
the more eastern star was now <i>twice as large as the other one</i>, though
on the preceding night they had been perfectly equal. This fact threw a
new light upon Galileo&rsquo;s difficulties, and he immediately drew the
conclusion, which he considered to be indubitable, &ldquo;<i>that there
were in the heavens three stars which revolved round Jupiter, in the
same manner as Venus and Mercury revolve round the sun</i>.&rdquo; On the
12th of January, he again observed them in new positions, and of
different magnitudes; and, on the 13th, he discovered a fourth star,
which completed the <i>four</i> secondary planets with which Jupiter is
surrounded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Galileo continued his observations on these bodies every clear night
till the 22d of March, and studied their motions in reference to fixed
stars that were at the same time within the field of his telescope.
Having thus clearly established that the four new stars were satellites
or moons, which revolved round Jupiter in the same manner as the moon
revolves round our own globe, he drew up an account of his discovery, in
which he gave to the four new bodies the names of the <i>Medicean Stars</i>,
in honour of his patron, Cosmo de Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. This
work, under the title of &ldquo;Nuncius Sidereus,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;Sidereal Messenger,&rdquo; was dedicated to the same prince; and
the dedication bears the date of the 24th of March, only two days after
he concluded his observations.</p>

<p>The importance of this great discovery was instantly felt by the enemies
as well as by the friends of the Copernican system. The planets had
hitherto been distinguished from the fixed stars only by their relative
change of place, but the telescope proved them to be bodies so near to
our own globe as to exhibit well-defined discs, while the fixed stars
retained, even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
when magnified, the minuteness of remote and lucid points. The system of
Jupiter, illuminated by four moons performing their revolutions in
different and regular periods, exhibited to the proud reason of man the
comparative insignificance of the globe he inhabits, and proclaimed in
impressive language that that globe was not the centre of the universe.</p>

<p>The reception which these discoveries met with from Kepler is highly
interesting, and characteristic of the genius of that great man. He was
one day sitting idle, and thinking of Galileo, when his friend
Wachenfels stopped his carriage at his door, to communicate to him the
intelligence. &ldquo;Such a fit of wonder,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;seized
me at a report which seemed to be so very absurd, and I was thrown into
such agitation at seeing an old dispute between us decided in this way,
that between his joy, my colouring, and the laughter of both, confounded
as we were by such a novelty, we were hardly capable, he of speaking, or
I of listening. On our parting, I immediately began to think how there
could be any addition to the number of the planets without overturning
my &lsquo;Cosmographic Mystery,&rsquo; according to which
Euclid&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
five regular solids do not allow more than six planets round the sun....
I am so far from disbelieving the existence of the four circumjovial
planets, that I long for a telescope, to anticipate you, if possible, in
discovering <i>two</i> round Mars, as the proportion seems to require, <i>six</i>
or <i>eight</i> round Saturn, and perhaps <i>one</i> each round Mercury and
Venus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a very different spirit did the Aristotelians receive the
&ldquo;Sidereal Messenger&rdquo; of Galileo. The principal professor of
philosophy at Padua resisted Galileo&rsquo;s repeated and urgent
entreaties to look at the moon and planets through his telescope; and he
even laboured to convince the Grand Duke that the satellites of Jupiter
could not possibly exist. Sizzi, an astronomer of Florence, maintained
that as there were only <i>seven</i> apertures in the head&mdash;<i>two</i> eyes, <i>two</i>
ears, <i>two</i> nostrils, and <i>one</i> mouth&mdash;and as there were only <i>seven</i>
metals, and <i>seven</i> days in the week, so there could be only <i>seven</i>
planets. He seems, however, to have admitted the visibility of the four
satellites through the telescope; but he argues, that as they are
invisible to the naked eye, they can exercise no influence on the earth;
and being useless, they do not therefore exist.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
A <i>proteg&eacute;</i> of Kepler&rsquo;s, of the name of Horky, wrote a volume
against Galileo&rsquo;s discovery, after having declared, &ldquo;that he
would never concede his four new planets to that Italian from Padua,
even if he should die for it.&rdquo; This resolute Aristotelian was at
no loss for arguments. He asserted that he had examined the heavens
<i>through Galileo&rsquo;s own glass</i>, and that no such thing as a
satellite existed round Jupiter. He affirmed, that he did not more
surely know that he had a soul in his body, than that reflected rays are
the sole cause of Galileo&rsquo;s erroneous observations; and that the
only use of the new planets was to gratify Galileo&rsquo;s thirst for
gold, and afford to himself a subject of discussion.</p>

<p>When Horky first presented himself to Kepler, after the publication of
this work, the opinion of his patron was announced to him by a burst of
indignation which overwhelmed the astonished author. Horky supplicated
mercy for his offence; and, as Kepler himself informed Galileo, he took
him again into favour, on the condition that Kepler was to show him
Jupiter&rsquo;s satellites, and that Horky was not only to see them, but
to admit their existence.</p>

<p>When the spirit of philosophy had thus left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the individuals who bore so unworthily her sacred name, it was fortunate
for science that it found a refuge among princes. Notwithstanding the
reiterated logic of his philosophical professor at Padua, Cosmo de
Medici preferred the testimony of his senses to the syllogisms of his
instructor. He observed the new planets several times, along with
Galileo, at Pisa; and when he parted with him, he gave him a present
worth more than 1000 florins, and concluded that liberal arrangement to
which we have already referred.</p>

<p>As philosopher and principal mathematician to the Grand Duke of Tuscany,
Galileo now took up his residence at Florence, with a salary of 1000
florins. No official duties, excepting that of lecturing occasionally to
sovereign princes, were attached to this appointment; and it was
expressly stipulated that he should enjoy the most perfect leisure to
complete his treatises on the constitution of the universe, on
mechanics, and on local motion. The resignation of his professorship in
the university of Padua, which was the necessary consequence of his new
appointment, created much dissatisfaction: but though many of his former
friends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
refused at first to hold any communication with him, this excitement
gradually subsided; and the Venetian senate at last appreciated the
feelings, as well as the motives, which induced a stranger to accept of
promotion in his native land.</p>

<p>While Galileo was enjoying the reward and the fame of his great
discovery, a new species of enmity was roused against him. Simon Mayer,
an astronomer of no character, pretended that he had discovered the
satellites of Jupiter before Galileo, and that his first observation was
made on the 29th of December, 1609. Other astronomers announced the
discovery of new satellites: Scheiner reckoned five, Rheita nine, and
others found even so many as twelve: these satellites, however, were
found to be only fixed stars. The names of <i>Vladislavian</i>, <i>Agrippine</i>,
<i>Uranodavian</i>, and <i>Ferdinandotertian</i>, which were hastily given to
these common telescopic stars, soon disappeared from the page of
science, and even the splendid telescopes of modern times have not been
able to add another gem to the diadem of Jupiter.</p>

<p>A modern astronomer of no mean celebrity has, even in the present day,
endeavoured to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
rob Galileo of this staple article of his reputation. From a careless
examination of the papers of our celebrated countryman, Thomas Harriot,
which Baron Zach had made in 1784, at Petworth, the seat of Lord
Egremont, this astronomer has asserted<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
that Harriot first observed the satellites of Jupiter on the 16th of
January, 1610; and continued his observations till the 25th of February,
1612. Baron Zach adds the following extraordinary
conclusion:&mdash;&ldquo;Galileo pretends to have discovered them on the
7th of January, 1610; so that it is not improbable that Harriot was
likewise the first discoverer of these attendants of Jupiter.&rdquo; In
a communication which I received from Dr Robertson, of Oxford, in
1822,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
he informed me that he had examined a portion of Harriot&rsquo;s papers,
entitled, &ldquo;De Jovialibus Planetis;&rdquo; and that it appears,
from two pages of these papers, <i>that Harriot first observed
Jupiter&rsquo;s satellites on the 17th of October, 1610</i>. These
observations are accompanied with rough drawings of the positions of the
satellites, and rough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
calculations of their periodical revolutions. My friend, Professor
Rigaud,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
who has very recently examined the Harriot MSS., has confirmed the
accuracy of Dr Robertson&rsquo;s observations, and has thus restored to
Galileo the honour of being the first and the sole discoverer of these
secondary planets.</p>

<p>The great success which attended the first telescopic observations of
Galileo, induced him to apply his best instruments to the other planets
of our system. The attempts which had been made to deprive him of the
honour of some of his discoveries, combined, probably, with a desire to
repeat his observations with better telescopes, led him to announce his
discoveries under the veil of an enigma, and to invite astronomers to
declare, within a given time, if they had observed any new phenomena in
the heavens.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Before the close of 1610, Galileo excited the curiosity of astronomers
by the publication of his first enigma. Kepler and others tried in vain
to decipher it; but in consequence of the Emperor Rodolph requesting a
solution of the puzzle, Galileo sent him the following clue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Altissimam planetam tergeminam observavi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have observed that the most remote planet is triple.</p></div>

<p>In explaining more fully the nature of his observation, Galileo remarked
that Saturn was not a single star, but three together, nearly touching
one another. He described them as having no relative motion, and as
having the form of three o&rsquo;s, namely, oOo, the central one being
larger than those on each side of it.</p>

<p>Although Galileo had announced that nothing new appeared in the other
planets, yet he soon communicated to the world another discovery of no
slight interest. The enigmatical letters in which it was concealed
formed the following sentence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Cynthi&aelig; figuras &aelig;mulatur mater Amorum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Venus rivals the phases of the moon.</p></div>

<p>Hitherto, Galileo had observed Venus when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
her disc was largely illuminated; but having directed his telescope to
her when she was not far removed from the sun, he saw her in the form of
a crescent, resembling exactly the moon at the same elongation. He
continued to observe her night after night, during the whole time that
she could be seen in the course of her revolution round the sun, and he
found that she exhibited the very same phases which resulted from her
motion round that luminary.</p>

<p>Galileo had long contemplated a visit to the metropolis of Italy, and he
accordingly carried his intentions into effect in the early part of the
year 1611. Here he was received with that distinction which was due to
his great talents and his extended reputation. Princes, Cardinals, and
Prelates hastened to do him honour; and even those who discredited his
discoveries, and dreaded their results, vied with the true friends of
science in their anxiety to see the intellectual wonder of the age.</p>

<p>In order to show the new celestial phenomena to his friends at Rome,
Galileo took with him his best telescope; and as he had discovered the
spots on the sun&rsquo;s surface in October or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
November 1610, or even earlier,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
he had the gratification of exhibiting them to his admiring disciples.
He accordingly erected his telescope in the Quirinal garden, belonging
to Cardinal Bandini; and in April 1611 he shewed them to his friends in
many of their most interesting variations. From their change of position
on the sun&rsquo;s disc, Galileo at first inferred, either that the sun
revolved about an axis, or that other planets, like Venus and Mercury,
revolved so near the sun as to appear like black spots when they were
opposite to his disc. Upon continuing his observations, however, he saw
reason to abandon this hasty opinion. He found that the spots must be in
contact with the surface of the sun,&mdash;that their figures were
irregular,&mdash;that they had different degrees of darkness,&mdash;that
one spot would often divide itself into three or four,&mdash;that three
or four spots would often unite themselves into one,&mdash;and that all
the spots revolved regularly with the sun, which appeared to complete
its revolution in about twenty-eight days.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Previous to the invention of the telescope, spots had been more than
once seen on the sun&rsquo;s disc with the unassisted eye. But even if
these were of the same character as those which Galileo and others
observed, we cannot consider them as anticipations of their discovery by
the telescope. As the telescope was now in the possession of several
astronomers, Galileo began to have many rivals in discovery; but
notwithstanding the claims of Harriot, Fabricius, and Scheiner, it is
now placed beyond the reach of doubt that he was the first discoverer of
the solar spots. From the communication which I received in 1822 from
the late Dr Robertson, of Oxford,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
it appeared that Thomas Harriot had observed the solar spots on the 8th
of December 1610; but his manuscripts, in Lord Egremont&rsquo;s
possession,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
incontestably prove that his regular observations on the spots did not
commence till December 1, 1611, although he had seen the spots at the
date above mentioned, and that they were continued till the 18th
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
January 1613. The observations which he has recorded are 199 in number,
and the accounts of them are accompanied with rough drawings
representing the number, position, and magnitude of the spots.<a
name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
In the observation of Harriot, made on the 8th December 1610, before he
knew of Galileo&rsquo;s discovery, he saw three spots on the sun, which
he has represented in a diagram. The sun was then 7&deg; or 8&deg; high,
and there was a frost and a mist, which no doubt acted as a darkening
glass. Harriot does not apply the name of spots to what he noticed in
this observation, and he does not enumerate it among the 199
observations above mentioned. Professor Rigaud<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
considers it &ldquo;a misapplication of terms to call such an
observation a discovery;&rdquo; but, with all the respect which we feel
for the candour of this remark, we are disposed to confer on Harriot the
merit of an original discoverer of the spots on the sun.</p>

<p>Another candidate for the honour of discovering the spots of the sun,
was John Fabricius,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
who undoubtedly saw them previous to June 1611. The dedication of the
work<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
in which he has recorded his observation, bears the date of the 13th of
June 1611; and it is obvious, from the work itself, that he had seen the
spots about the end of the year 1610; but as there is no proof that he
saw them before October, we are compelled to assign the priority of the
discovery to the Italian astronomer.</p>

<p>The claim of Scheiner, professor of mathematics at Ingolstadt, is more
intimately connected with the history of Galileo. This learned
astronomer having, early in 1611, turned his telescope to the sun,
necessarily discovered the spots which at that time covered his disc.
Light flying clouds happened, at the time, to weaken the intensity of
his light, so that he was able to show the spots to his pupils. These
observations were not published till January 1612; and they appeared in
the form of three letters, addressed to Mark Velser, one of the
magistrates of Augsburg, under the signature of <i>Appelles post Tabulam</i>.
Scheiner, who, many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
years afterwards, published an elaborate work on the subject, adopted
the same idea which had at first occurred to Galileo&mdash;that the
spots were the dark sides of planets revolving round and near the sun.<a
name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
On the publication of Scheiner&rsquo;s letters, Velser transmitted a
copy of them to his friend Galileo, with the request that he would
favour him with his opinion of the new phenomena. After some delay,
Galileo addressed three letters to Velser, in which he combated the
opinions of Scheiner on the cause of the spots. The first of these
letters was dated the 4th of May 1612;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
but though the controversy was carried on in the language of mutual
respect and esteem, it put an end to the friendship which had existed
<ins class='corr' title="The original read 'betwen'.">between</ins>
the two astronomers. In these letters Galileo showed that the spots
often dispersed like vapours or clouds; that they sometimes had a
duration of only one or two days, and at other times of thirty or forty
days; that they contracted in their breadth when they approached the
sun&rsquo;s limb, without any diminution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of their length; that they describe circles parallel to each other; that
the monthly rotation of the sun again brings the same spots into view;
and that they are seldom seen at a greater distance than 30&deg; from
the sun&rsquo;s equator. Galileo likewise discovered on the sun&rsquo;s
disc <i>facul&aelig;</i>, or <i>luculi</i>, as they were called, which differ in
no respect from the common ones but in their being brighter than the
rest of the sun&rsquo;s surface.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In the last of the letters which our author addressed to Velser, and
which was written in December 1612, he recurs to his former discovery of
the elongated shape, or rather the triple structure, of Saturn. The
singular figure which he had observed in this planet had entirely
disappeared; and he evidently announces the fact to Velser, lest it
should be used by his enemies to discredit the accuracy of his
observations. &ldquo;Looking on Saturn,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;within
these few days, I found it solitary, without the assistance of its
accustomed stars, and, in short, perfectly round and defined like
Jupiter; and such it still remains. Now, what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
can be said of so strange a metamorphosis? Are the two smaller stars
consumed like the spots on the sun? Have they suddenly vanished and
fled? or has Saturn devoured his own children? or was the appearance
indeed fraud and illusion, with which the glasses have for so long a
time mocked me, and so many others who have often observed with me? Now,
perhaps, the time is come to revive the withering hopes of those who,
guided by more profound contemplations, have followed all the fallacies
of the new observations, and recognised their impossibilities. I cannot
resolve what to say in a chance so strange, so new, and so unexpected;
the shortness of the time, the unexampled occurrence, the weakness of my
intellect, and the terror of being mistaken, have greatly confounded
me.&rdquo; Although Galileo struggled to obtain a solution of this
mystery, yet he had not the good fortune to succeed. He imagined that
the two smaller stars would reappear, in consequence of the supposed
revolution of the planet round its axis; but the discovery of the ring
of Saturn, and of the obliquity of its plane to the ecliptic, was
necessary to explain the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
phenomena which were so perplexing to our author.</p>

<p>The ill health to which Galileo was occasionally subject, and the belief
that the air of Florence was prejudicial to his complaints, induced him
to spend much of his time at Selve, the villa of his friend Salviati.
This eminent individual had ever been the warmest friend of Galileo, and
seems to have delighted in drawing round him the scientific genius of
the age. He was a member of the celebrated Lync&aelig;an Society, founded by
Prince Frederigo Cesi; and though he is not known as the author of any
important discovery, yet he has earned, by his liberality to science, a
glorious name, which will be indissolubly united with the immortal
destiny of Galileo.</p>

<p>The subject of floating bridges having been discussed at one of the
scientific parties which had assembled at the house of Salviati, a
difference of opinion arose respecting the influence of the shape of
bodies on their disposition to float or to sink in a fluid. Contrary to
the general opinion, Galileo undertook to prove that it depended on
other causes; and he was thus led to compose his discourse on floating
bodies,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
which was published in 1612, and dedicated to Cosmo de Medici. This work
contains many ingenious experiments, and much acute reasoning in support
of the true principles of hydrostatics; and it is now chiefly remarkable
as a specimen of the sagacity and intellectual power of its author. Like
all his other works, it encountered the most violent opposition; and
Galileo was more than once summoned into the field to repel the
aggressions of his ignorant and presumptuous opponents. The first attack
upon it was made by Ptolemy Nozzolini, in a letter to Marzemedici,
Archbishop of Florence;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and to this Galileo replied in a letter addressed to his antagonist.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
A more elaborate examination of it was published by Lodovico delle
Colombe, and another by M. Vincenzo di Grazia. To these attacks, a
minute and overwhelming answer was printed in the name of Benedetti
Castelli, the friend and pupil of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Galileo; but it was discovered, some years after Galileo&rsquo;s death,
that he was himself the author of this work.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The current of Galileo&rsquo;s life had hitherto flowed in a smooth and
unobstructed channel. He had now attained the highest objects of earthly
ambition. His discoveries had placed him at the head of the great men of
the age; he possessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a professional income far beyond <ins class='corr' title="The original
read 'his his'.">his</ins> wants, and even beyond his anticipations; and, what
is still dearer to a philosopher, he enjoyed the most perfect leisure
for carrying on and completing his discoveries. The opposition which
these discoveries encountered, was to him more a subject for triumph
than for sorrow. Prejudice and ignorance were his only enemies; and if
they succeeded for a while in harassing his march, it was only to lay a
foundation for fresh achievements. He who contends for truths which he
has himself been permitted to discover, may well sustain the conflict in
which presumption and error are destined to fall. The public tribunal
may neither be sufficiently pure nor enlightened to decide upon the
issue; but he can appeal to posterity, and reckon with confidence on
&ldquo;its sure decree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ardour of Galileo&rsquo;s mind, the keenness of his temper, his
clear perception of truth, and his inextinguishable love of it, combined
to exasperate and prolong the hostility of his enemies. When argument
failed to enlighten their judgment, and reason to dispel their
prejudices, he wielded against them his powerful weapons of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
ridicule and sarcasm; and in this unrelenting warfare, he seems to have
forgotten that Providence had withheld from his enemies those very gifts
which he had so liberally received. He who is allowed to take the start
of his species, and to penetrate the veil which conceals from common
minds the mysteries of nature, must not expect that the world will be
patiently dragged at the chariot wheels of his philosophy. Mind has its
inertia as well as matter; and its progress to truth can only be insured
by the gradual and patient removal of the obstructions which surround
it.</p>

<p>The boldness&mdash;may we not say the recklessness&mdash;with which Galileo
insisted upon making proselytes of his enemies, served but to alienate
them from the truth. Errors thus assailed speedily entrench themselves
in general feelings, and become embalmed in the virulence of the
passions. The various classes of his opponents marshalled themselves for
their mutual defence. The Aristotelian professors, the temporising
Jesuits, the political churchmen, and that timid but respectable body
who at all times dread innovation, whether it be in religion or in
science, entered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
into an alliance against the philosophical tyrant who threatened them
with the penalties of knowledge.</p>

<p>The party of Galileo, though weak in numbers, was not without power and
influence. He had trained around him a devoted band, who idolised his
genius and cherished his doctrines. His pupils had been appointed to
several of the principal professorships in Italy. The enemies of
religion were on this occasion united with the Christian philosopher;
and there were, even in these days, many princes and nobles who had felt
the inconvenience of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and who secretly
abetted Galileo in his crusade against established errors.</p>

<p>Although these two parties had been long dreading each others power, and
reconnoitring each others position, yet we cannot exactly determine
which of them hoisted the first signal for war. The church party,
particularly its highest dignitaries, were certainly disposed to rest on
the defensive. Flanked on one side by the logic of the schools, and on
the other by the popular interpretation of Scripture, and backed by the
strong arm of the civil power, they were not disposed to interfere with
the prosecution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of science, however much they may have dreaded its influence. The
philosophers, on the contrary, united the zeal of innovators with that
firmness of purpose which truth alone can inspire. Victorious in every
contest, they were flushed with success, and they panted for a struggle
in which they knew they must triumph.</p>

<p>In this state of warlike preparation Galileo addressed a letter, in
1613, to his friend and pupil, the Abb&eacute; Castelli, the object of which
was to prove that the Scriptures were not intended to teach us science
and philosophy. Hence he inferred, that the language employed in the
sacred volume in reference to such subjects should be interpreted only
in its common acceptation; and that it was in reality as difficult to
reconcile the Ptolemaic as the Copernican system to the expressions
which occur in the Bible.</p>

<p>A demonstration was about this time made by the opposite party, in the
person of Caccini, a Dominican friar, who made a personal attack upon
Galileo from the pulpit. This violent ecclesiastic ridiculed the
astronomer and his followers, by addressing them sarcastically in the
sacred language of Scripture&mdash;&ldquo;Ye men of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
<i>Galilee</i>, why stand ye here looking up into heaven?&rdquo; But this
species of warfare was disapproved of even by the church; and Luigi
Maraffi, the general of the Dominicans, not only apologised to Galileo,
who had transmitted to him a formal complaint against Caccini, but
expressed the acuteness of his own feelings on being implicated in the
&ldquo;brutal conduct of thirty or forty thousand monks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the character of Caccini, and the part which he afterwards played
in the persecution of Galileo, we can scarcely avoid the opinion that
his attack from the pulpit was intended as a snare for the unwary
philosopher. It roused Galileo from his wonted caution; and stimulated,
no doubt, by the nature of the answer which he received from Maraffi, he
published a long letter of seventy pages, defending and illustrating his
former views respecting the influence of scriptural language on the two
contending systems. As if to give the impress of royal authority to this
new appeal, he addressed it to Christian, Grand Duchess of Tuscany, the
mother of Cosmo; and in this form it seems to have excited a new
interest, as if it had expressed the opinion of the grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
ducal family. These external circumstances gave additional weight to the
powerful and unanswerable reasoning which this letter contains; and it
was scarcely possible that any man, possessed of a sound mind, and
willing to learn the truth, should refuse his assent to the judicious
views of our author. He expresses his belief that the Scriptures were
designed to instruct mankind respecting their salvation, and that the
faculties of our minds were given us for the purpose of investigating
the phenomena of nature. He considers Scripture and nature as proceeding
from the same divine author, and, therefore, incapable of speaking a
different language; and he points out the absurdity of supposing that
professors of astronomy will shut their eyes to the phenomena which they
discover in the heavens, or will refuse to believe those deductions of
reason which appeal to their judgment with all the power of
demonstration. He supports these views by quotations from the ancient
fathers; and he refers to the dedication of Copernicus&rsquo;s own work
to the Roman Pontiff, Paul III., as a proof that the Pope himself did
not regard the new system of the world as hostile to the sacred
writings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Copernicus, on the contrary, tells his Holiness, that the reason of
inscribing to him his new system was, that the authority of the Pontiff
might put to silence the calumnies of some individuals, who attacked it
by arguments drawn from passages of Scripture twisted for their own
purpose.</p>

<p>It was in vain to meet such reasoning by any other weapons than those of
the civil power. The enemies of Galileo saw that they must either crush
the dangerous innovation, or allow it the fullest scope; and they
determined upon an appeal to the inquisition. Lorini, a monk of the
Dominican order, had already denounced to this body Galileo&rsquo;s
letter to Castelli; and Caccini, bribed by the mastership of the convent
of St Mary of Minerva, was invited to settle at Rome for the purpose of
embodying the evidence against Galileo.</p>

<p>Though these plans had been carried on in secret, yet Galileo&rsquo;s
suspicions were excited; and he obtained leave from Cosmo to go to Rome
about the end of 1615.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Here he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> lodged in the palace of the Grand Duke&rsquo;s
ambassador, and kept up a constant correspondence with the family of his
patron at Florence; but, in the midst of this external splendour, he was
summoned before the inquisition to answer for the heretical doctrines
which he had published. He was charged with maintaining the motion of
the earth, and the stability of the sun&mdash;with teaching this
doctrine to his pupils&mdash;with corresponding on the subject with
several German mathematicians&mdash;and with having published it, and
attempted to reconcile it to Scripture, in his letters to Mark Velser in
1612. The inquisition assembled to consider these charges on the 25th of
February 1615; and it was decreed that Galileo should be enjoined by
Cardinal Bellarmine to renounce the obnoxious doctrines, and to pledge
himself that he would neither teach, defend, nor publish them in future.
In the event of his refusing to acquiesce in this sentence, it was
decreed that he should be thrown into prison. Galileo did not hesitate
to yield to this injunction. On the day following, the 26th of February,
he appeared before Cardinal Bellarmine, to renounce his heretical
opinions; and, having declared that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he abandoned the doctrine of the earth&rsquo;s motion, and would neither
defend nor teach it, in his conversation or in his writings, he was
dismissed from the bar of the inquisition.</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of Galileo, the inquisition conceived the design of
condemning the whole system of Copernicus as heretical. Galileo, with
more hardihood than prudence, remained at Rome for the purpose of giving
his assistance in frustrating this plan; but there is reason to think
that he injured by his presence the very cause which he meant to
support. The inquisitors had determined to put down the new opinions;
and they now inserted among the prohibited books Galileo&rsquo;s letters
to Castelli and the Grand Duchess, Kepler&rsquo;s epitome of the
Copernican theory, and Copernicus&rsquo;s own work on the revolutions of
the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these proceedings, Galileo had an audience of the Pope,
Paul V., in March 1616. He was received very graciously, and spent
nearly an hour with his Holiness. When they were about to part, the Pope
assured Galileo, that the congregation were not disposed to receive upon
light grounds any calumnies which might be propagated by his enemies,
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that, as long as he occupied the papal chair, he might consider himself
as safe.</p>

<p>These assurances were no doubt founded on the belief that Galileo would
adhere to his pledges; but so bold and inconsiderate was he in the
expression of his opinions, that even in Rome he was continually engaged
in controversial discussions. The following very interesting account of
these disputes is given by Querenghi, in a letter to the Cardinal
D&rsquo;Este:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your eminence would be delighted with Galileo if you heard him
holding forth, as he often does, in the midst of fifteen or twenty, all
violently attacking him, sometimes in one house, sometimes in another.
But he is armed after such fashion that he laughs all of them to scorn;
and even if the novelty of his opinions prevents entire persuasion, he
at least convicts of emptiness most of the arguments with which his
adversaries endeavour to overwhelm him. He was particularly admirable on
Monday last in the house of Signor Frederico Ghisilieri; and what
especially pleased me was, that before replying to the contrary
arguments, he amplified and enforced them with new grounds of great
plausibility, so as to leave his adversaries in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
more ridiculous plight, when he afterwards overturned them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The discovery of Jupiter&rsquo;s satellites suggested to Galileo a new
method of finding the longitude at sea. Philip III. had encouraged
astronomers to direct their attention to this problem, by offering a
reward for its solution; and in those days, when new discoveries in
science were sometimes rejected as injurious to mankind, it was no
common event to see a powerful sovereign courting the assistance of
astronomers in promoting the commercial interests of his empire. Galileo
seems to have regarded the solution of this problem as an object worthy
of his ambition; and he no doubt anticipated the triumph which he would
obtain over his enemies, if the Medicean stars, which they had treated
with such contempt, could be made subservient to the great interests of
mankind. During his residence at Rome in 1615 and 1616, Galileo had
communicated his views on this subject to the Comte di Lemos, the
Viceroy of Naples, who had presided over the council of the Spanish
Indies. This nobleman advised him to apply to the Spanish minister the
Duke of Lerma; and, through the influence of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Grand Duke Cosmo, his ambassador at the court of Madrid was engaged to
manage the affair. The anxiety of Galileo on this subject was singularly
great. He assured the Tuscan ambassador that, in order to accomplish
this object, &ldquo;he was ready to leave all his comforts, his country,
his friends, and his family, to cross over into Spain, and to stay as
long as he might be wanted at Seville or at Lisbon, or wherever it might
be convenient to communicate a knowledge of his method.&rdquo; The
lethargy of the Spanish court seems to have increased with the
enthusiasm of Galileo; and though the negotiations were occasionally
revived for ten or twelve years, yet no steps were taken to bring them
to a close. This strange procrastination has been generally ascribed to
jealousy or indifference on the part of Spain; but Nelli, one of
Galileo&rsquo;s biographers, declares, on the authority of Florentine
records, that Cosmo had privately requested from the government the
privilege of sending annually to the Spanish Indies two Leghorn
merchantmen free of duty, as a compensation for the loss of Galileo!</p>

<p>The failure of this negotiation must have been a source of extreme
mortification to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
high spirit and sanguine temperament of Galileo. He had calculated,
however, too securely on his means of putting the new method to a
successful trial. The great imperfection of the time-keepers of that
day, and the want of proper telescopes, would have baffled him in all
his efforts, and he would have been subject to a more serious
mortification from the failure and rejection of his plan, than that
which he actually experienced from the avarice of his patron, or the
indifference of Spain. Even in the present day, no telescope has been
invented which is capable of observing at sea the eclipses of
Jupiter&rsquo;s satellites; and though this method of finding the
longitude has great advantages on shore, yet it has been completely
abandoned at sea, and superseded by easier and more correct methods.</p>

<p>In the year 1618, when no fewer than <i>three</i> comets visited our system,
and attracted the attention of all the astronomers of Europe, Galileo
was unfortunately confined to his bed by a severe illness; but, though
he was unable to make a single observation upon these remarkable bodies,
he contrived to involve himself in the controversies which they
occasioned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Marco Guiducci, an astronomer of Florence, and a friend of Galileo, had
delivered a discourse on comets before the Florentine Academy. The heads
of this discourse, which was published in 1619,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
were supposed to have been communicated to him by Galileo, and this
seems to have been universally admitted during the controversy to which
it gave rise. The opinion maintained in this treatise, that comets are
nothing but meteors which occasionally appear in our atmosphere, like
halos and rainbows, savours so little of the sagacity of Galileo that we
should be disposed to question its paternity. His inability to partake
in the general interest which these three comets excited, and to employ
his powerful telescope in observing their phenomena, and their
movements, might have had some slight share in the formation of an
opinion which deprived them of their importance as celestial bodies.
But, however this may have been, the treatise of Guiducci afforded a
favourable point of attack to Galileo&rsquo;s enemies, and the dangerous
task<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
was entrusted to Horatio Grassi, a learned Jesuit, who, in a work
entitled <i>The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance</i>, criticised the
discourse on comets, under the feigned name of Lotario Sarsi.</p>

<p>Galileo replied to this attack in a volume entitled <i>Il Saggiatore</i>, or
<i>The Assayer</i>, which, owing to the state of his health, was not
published till the autumn of 1623.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
This work was written in the form of a letter to Virginio Cesarini, a
member of the Lync&aelig;an Academy, and master of the chamber to Urban
VIII., who had just ascended the papal throne. It was dedicated to the
Pontiff himself, and has been long celebrated among literary men for the
beauty of its language, though it is doubtless one of the least
important of Galileo&rsquo;s writings.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_GV" id="CHAPTER_GV"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

Son&mdash;Galileo in pecuniary difficulties, owing to the death of his

<p>The succession of the Cardinal Maffeo Barberini to the papal throne,
under the name of Urban VIII., was hailed by Galileo and his friends as
an event favourable to the promotion of science. Urban had not only been
the personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
friend of Galileo and of Prince Cesi, the founder of the Lync&aelig;an
Academy, but had been intimately connected with that able and liberal
association; and it was therefore deemed prudent to secure his favour
and attachment. If Paul III. had, nearly a century before, patronised
Copernicus, and accepted of the dedication of his great work, it was not
unreasonable to expect that, in more enlightened times, another Pontiff
might exhibit the same liberality to science.</p>

<p>The plan of securing to Galileo the patronage of Urban VIII. seems to
have been devised by Prince Cesi. Although Galileo had not been able for
some years to travel, excepting in a litter, yet he was urged by the
Prince to perform a journey to Rome, for the express purpose of
congratulating his friend upon his elevation to the papal chair. This
request was made in October 1623; and though Galileo&rsquo;s health was
not such as to authorise him to undergo so much fatigue, yet he felt the
importance of the advice, and, after visiting Cesi at Acqua Sparta, he
arrived at Rome in the spring of 1624. The reception which he here
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
experienced far exceeded his most sanguine expectations. During the two
months which he spent in the capital he was permitted to have no fewer
than six long and gratifying audiences of the Pope. The kindness of his
Holiness was of the most marked description. He not only loaded Galileo
with presents,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
and promised him a pension for his son Vincenzo, but he wrote a letter
to Ferdinand, who had just succeeded Cosmo as Grand Duke of Tuscany,
recommending Galileo to his particular patronage. &ldquo;For we find in
him,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;not only literary distinction, but the love
of piety; and he is strong in those qualities by which Pontifical
good-will is easily obtained. And now, when he has been brought to this
city to congratulate us on our elevation, we have very lovingly embraced
him; nor can we suffer him to return to the country whither your
liberality recalls him, without an ample provision of Pontifical love.
And that you may know how dear he is to us, we have willed to give him
this honourable testimonial of virtue and piety. And we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
further signify, that every benefit which you shall confer upon him,
imitating or even surpassing your father&rsquo;s liberality, will
conduce to our gratification.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not content with thus securing the friendship of the Pope, Galileo
endeavoured to bespeak the good-will of the Cardinals towards the
Copernican system. He had, accordingly, many interviews with several of
these dignitaries; and he was assured, by Cardinal Hohenzoller, that in
a representation which he had made to the Pope on the subject of
Copernicus, he stated to his Holiness, &ldquo;that as all the heretics
considered that system as undoubted, it would be necessary to be very
circumspect in coming to any resolution on the subject.&rdquo; To this
remark his Holiness replied&mdash;&ldquo;that the church had not condemned
this system; and that it should not be condemned as heretical, but only
as rash;&rdquo; and he added, &ldquo;that there was no fear of any
person undertaking to prove that it must necessarily be true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The recent appointment of the Abb&eacute; Castelli, the friend and pupil of
Galileo, to be mathematician to the Pope, was an event of a most
gratifying nature; and when we recollect that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
it was to Castelli that he addressed the famous letter which was
pronounced heretical by the Inquisition, we must regard it also as an
event indicative of a new and favourable feeling towards the friends of
science. The opinions of Urban, indeed, had suffered no change. He was
one of the few Cardinals who had opposed the inquisitorial decree of
1616, and his subsequent demeanour was in every respect conformable to
the liberality of his early views. The sincerity of his conduct was
still further evinced by the grant of a pension of one hundred crowns to
Galileo, a few years after his visit to Rome; though there is reason to
think that this allowance was not regularly paid.</p>

<p>The death of Cosmo, whose liberality had given him both affluence and
leisure, threatened Galileo with pecuniary difficulties. He had been
involved in a &ldquo;great load of debt,&rdquo; owing to the
circumstances of his brother&rsquo;s family; and, in order to relieve
himself, he had requested Castelli to dispose of the pension of his son
Vincenzo. In addition to this calamity he was now alarmed at the
prospect of losing his salary as an extraordinary professor at Pisa. The
great youth of Ferdinand, who was scarcely of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
age, induced Galileo&rsquo;s enemies, in 1629, to raise doubts
respecting the payment of a salary to a professor who neither resided
nor lectured in the university; but the question was decided in his
favour, and we have no doubt that the decision was facilitated by the
friendly recommendation of the Pope, to which we have already referred.</p>

<p>Although Galileo had made a narrow escape from the grasp of the
Inquisition, yet he was never sufficiently sensible of the lenity which
he experienced. When he left Rome in 1616, under the solemn pledge of
never again teaching the obnoxious doctrine, it was with a hostility
against the church, suppressed but deeply cherished; and his resolution
to propagate the heresy seems to have been coeval with the vow by which
he renounced it. In the year 1618, when he communicated his theory of
the tides to the Archduke Leopold, he alludes in the most sarcastic
manner to the conduct of the church. The same hostile tone, more or
less, pervaded all his writings, and, while he laboured to sharpen the
edge of his satire, he endeavoured to guard himself against its effects,
by an affectation of the humblest deference to the decisions of
theology. Had Galileo stood alone, his devotion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to science might have withdrawn him from so hopeless a contest; but he
was spurred on by the violence of a party. The Lync&aelig;an Academy
never scrupled to summon him from his researches. They placed him in the
forlorn hope of their combat, and he at last fell a victim to the
rashness of his friends.</p>

<p>But whatever allowance we may make for the ardour of Galileo&rsquo;s
temper, and the peculiarity of his position; and however we may justify
and even approve of his past conduct, his visit to Urban VIII., in 1624,
placed him in a new relation to the church, which demanded on his part a
new and corresponding demeanour. The noble and generous reception which
he met with from Urban, and the liberal declaration of Cardinal
Hohenzoller on the subject of the Copernican system, should have been
regarded as expressions of regret for the past, and offers of
conciliation for the future. Thus honoured by the head of the church,
and befriended by its dignitaries, Galileo must have felt himself secure
against the indignities of its lesser functionaries, and in the
possession of the fullest license to prosecute his researches and
publish his discoveries, provided he avoided that dogma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of the church which, even in the present day, it has not ventured to
renounce. But Galileo was bound to the Romish hierarchy by even stronger
ties. His son and himself were pensioners of the church, and, having
accepted of its alms, they owed to it, at least, a decent and respectful
allegiance. The pension thus given by Urban was not a remuneration which
sovereigns sometimes award to the services of their subjects. Galileo
was a foreigner at Rome. The sovereign of the papal state owed him no
obligation; and hence we must regard the pension of Galileo as a
donation from the Roman Pontiff to science itself, and as a declaration
to the Christian world that religion was not jealous of philosophy, and
that the church of Rome was willing to respect and foster even the
genius of its enemies.</p>

<p>Galileo viewed all these circumstances in a different light. He resolved
to compose a work in which the Copernican system should be demonstrated;
but he had not the courage to do this in a direct and open manner. He
adopted the plan of discussing the subject in a dialogue between three
speakers, in the hope of eluding by this artifice the censure of the
church. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
work was completed in 1630, but, owing to some difficulties in obtaining
a license to print it, it was not published till 1632.</p>

<p>In obtaining this license, Galileo exhibited considerable address, and
his memory has not escaped from the imputation of having acted unfairly,
and of having involved his personal friends in the consequences of his
imprudence.</p>

<p>The situation of master of the palace was, fortunately for
Galileo&rsquo;s designs, filled by Nicolo Riccardi, a friend and pupil
of his own. This officer was a sort of censor of new publications, and
when he was applied to on the subject of printing his work, Galileo soon
found that attempts had previously been made to thwart his views. He
instantly set off for Rome, and had an interview with his friend, who
was in every respect anxious to oblige him. Riccardi examined the
manuscript, pointed out some incautious expressions which he considered
it necessary to erase, and returned it with his written approbation, on
the understanding that the alterations he suggested would be made.
Dreading to remain in Rome during the unhealthy season, which was fast
approaching, Galileo returned to Florence, with the intention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of completing the index and dedication, and of sending the MS. to Rome,
to be printed under the care of Prince Cesi. The death of that
distinguished individual, in August 1630, frustrated Galileo&rsquo;s
plan, and he applied for leave to have the book printed in Florence.
Riccardi was at first desirous to examine the MS. again, but, after
inspecting only the beginning and the end of it, he gave Galileo leave
to print it wherever he chose, providing it bore the license of the
Inquisitor-General of Florence, and one or two other persons whom he
named.</p>

<p>Having overcome all these difficulties, Galileo&rsquo;s work was
published in 1632, under the title of &ldquo;<i>The System of the World of
Galileo Galilei</i>, &amp;c., in which, in four dialogues concerning the two
principal systems of the world&mdash;the Ptolemaic and the Copernican&mdash;he
discusses, indeterminately and firmly, the arguments proposed on both
sides.&rdquo; It is dedicated to Ferdinand, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and
is prefaced by an &ldquo;Address to the prudent reader,&rdquo; which is
itself characterised by the utmost imprudence. He refers to the decree
of the Inquisition in the most insulting and ironical language. He
attributes it to passion and to ignorance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
not by direct assertion, but by insinuations ascribed to others; and he
announces his intention to defend the Copernican system, as a pure
mathematical hypothesis, and not as an opinion having an advantage over
that of the stability of the earth absolutely. The dialogue is conducted
by three persons, Salviati, Sagredo, and Simplicio. Salviati, who is the
true philosopher in the dialogue, was the real name of a nobleman whom
we have already had occasion to mention. Sagredo, the name of another
noble friend of Galileo&rsquo;s, performs a secondary part under
Salviati. He proposes doubts, suggests difficulties, and enlivens the
gravity of the dialogue with his wit and pleasantry. Simplicio is a
resolute follower of Ptolemy and Aristotle, and, with a proper degree of
candour and modesty, he brings forward all the common arguments in
favour of the Ptolemaic system. Between the wit of Sagredo, and the
powerful philosophy of Salviati, the peripatetic sage is baffled in
every discussion; and there can be no doubt that Galileo aimed a more
fatal blow at the Ptolemaic system by this mode of discussing it, than
if he had endeavoured to overturn it by direct arguments.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
The influence of this work on the public mind was such as might have
been anticipated. The obnoxious doctrines which it upheld were eagerly
received, and widely disseminated; and the church of Rome became
sensible of the shock which was thus given to its intellectual
supremacy. Pope Urban VIII., attached though he had been to Galileo,
never once hesitated respecting the line of conduct which he felt
himself bound to pursue. His mind was, nevertheless, agitated with
conflicting sentiments. He entertained a sincere affection for science
and literature, and yet he was placed in the position of their enemy. He
had been the personal friend of Galileo, and yet his duty compelled him
to become his accuser. Embarrassing as these feelings were, other
considerations contributed to soothe him. He had, in his capacity of a
Cardinal, opposed the first persecution of Galileo. He had, since his
elevation to the pontificate, traced an open path for the march of
Galileo&rsquo;s discoveries; and he had finally endeavoured to bind the
recusant philosopher by the chains of kindness and gratitude. All these
means, however, had proved abortive, and he was now called upon to
support<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the doctrine which he had subscribed, and administer the law of which he
was the guardian.</p>

<p>It has been supposed, without any satisfactory evidence, that Urban may
have been influenced by less creditable motives. Salviati and Sagredo
being well-known personages, it was inferred that Simplicio must also
have a representative. The enemies of Galileo are said to have convinced
his Holiness that Simplicio was intended as a portraiture of himself;
and this opinion received some probability from the fact, that the
peripatetic disputant had employed many of the arguments which Urban had
himself used in his discussions with Galileo. The latest biographer of
Galileo<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
regards this motive as necessary to account for &ldquo;the otherwise
inexplicable change which took place in the conduct of Urban to his old
friend;&rdquo;&mdash;but we cannot admit the truth of this supposition.
The church had been placed in hostility to a powerful and liberal party,
which was adverse to its interests. The dogmas of the Catholic faith had
been brought into direct collision with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
deductions of science. The leader of the philosophic band had broken the
most solemn armistice with the Inquisition: he had renounced the ties of
gratitude which bound him to the Pontiff; and Urban was thus compelled
to entrench himself in a position to which he had been driven by his
opponents.</p>

<p>The design of summoning Galileo before the Inquisition, seems to have
been formed almost immediately after the publication of his book; for
even in August 1632, the preliminary proceedings had reached the ears of
the Grand Duke Ferdinand. The Tuscan ambassador at Rome was speedily
acquainted with the dissatisfaction which his Sovereign felt at these
proceedings; and he was instructed to forward to Florence a written
statement of the charges against Galileo, in order to enable him to
prepare for his defence. Although this request was denied, Ferdinand
again interposed, and transmitted a letter to his ambassador,
recommending the admission of Campanella and Castelli into the
congregation of ecclesiastics by whom Galileo was to be judged.
Circumstances, however, rendered it prudent to withhold this letter.
Castelli was sent away from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Rome, and Scipio Chiaramonte, a bigotted ecclesiastic, was summoned from
Pisa to complete the number of the judges.</p>

<p>It appears from a despatch of the Tuscan minister, that Ferdinand was
enraged at the transaction; and he instructed his ambassador, Niccolini,
to make the strongest representations to the Pope. Niccolini had several
interviews with his Holiness; but all his expostulations were fruitless.
He found Urban highly incensed against Galileo; and his Holiness begged
Niccolini to advise the Archduke not to interfere any farther, as he
would not &ldquo;get through it with honour.&rdquo; On the 15th of
September the Pope caused it to be intimated to Niccolini, as a mark of
his especial esteem for the Grand Duke, that he was obliged to refer the
work to the Inquisition; but both the prince and his ambassador were
declared liable to the usual censures if they divulged the secret.</p>

<p>From the measures which this tribunal had formerly pursued, it was not
difficult to foresee the result of their present deliberations. They
summoned Galileo to appear before them at Rome, to answer in person the
charges under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
which he lay. The Tuscan ambassador expostulated warmly with the court
of Rome on the inhumanity of this proceeding. He urged his advanced age,
his infirm health, the discomforts of the journey, and the miseries of
the quarantine,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
as motives for reconsidering their decision: But the Pope was
inexorable, and though it was agreed to relax the quarantine as much as
possible in his favour, yet it was declared indispensable that he should
appear in person before the Inquisition.</p>

<p>Worn out with age and infirmities, and exhausted with the fatigues of
his journey, Galileo arrived at Rome on the 14th of February, 1633. The
Tuscan ambassador announced his arrival in an official form to the
commissary of the holy office, and Galileo awaited in calm dignity the
approach of his trial. Among those who proffered their advice in this
distressing emergency, we must enumerate the Cardinal Barberino, the
Pope&rsquo;s nephew, who, though he may have felt the necessity of an
interference on the part of the church, was yet desirous that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
it should be effected with the least injury to Galileo and to science.
He accordingly visited Galileo, and advised him to remain as much at
home as possible, to keep aloof from general society, and to see only
his most intimate friends. The same advice was given from different
quarters; and Galileo, feeling its propriety, remained in strict
seclusion in the palace of the Tuscan ambassador.</p>

<p>During the whole of the trial which had now commenced, Galileo was
treated with the most marked indulgence. Abhorring, as we must do, the
principles and practice of this odious tribunal, and reprobating its
interference with the cautious deductions of science, we must yet admit
that, on this occasion, its deliberations were not dictated by passion,
nor its power directed by vengeance. Though placed at their
judgment-seat as a heretic, Galileo stood there with the recognised
attributes of a sage; and though an offender against the laws of which
they were the guardian, yet the highest respect was yielded to his
genius, and the kindest commiseration to his infirmities.</p>

<p>In the beginning of April, when his examination in person was to
commence, it became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
necessary that he should be removed to the holy office; but instead of
committing him, as was the practice, to solitary confinement, he was
provided with apartments in the house of the fiscal of the Inquisition.
His table was provided by the Tuscan ambassador, and his servant was
allowed to attend him at his pleasure, and to sleep in an adjoining
apartment. Even this nominal confinement, however, Galileo&rsquo;s high
spirit was unable to brook. An attack of the disease to which he was
constitutionally subject contributed to fret and irritate him, and he
became impatient for a release from his anxiety as well as from his
bondage. Cardinal Barberino seems to have received notice of the state
of Galileo&rsquo;s feelings, and, with a magnanimity which posterity
will ever honour, he liberated the philosopher on his own
responsibility; and in ten days after his first examination, and on the
last day of April, he was restored to the hospitable roof of the Tuscan
ambassador.</p>

<p>Though this favour was granted on the condition of his remaining in
strict seclusion, Galileo recovered his health, and to a certain degree
his usual hilarity, amid the kind attentions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of Niccolini and his family; and when the want of exercise had begun to
produce symptoms of indisposition, the Tuscan minister obtained for him
leave to go into the public gardens in a half-closed carriage.</p>

<p>After the Inquisition had examined Galileo personally, they allowed him
a reasonable time for preparing his defence. He felt the difficulty of
adducing any thing like a plausible justification of his conduct; and he
resorted to an ingenious, though a shallow artifice, which was regarded
by the court as an aggravation of the crime. After his first appearance
before the Inquisition in 1616, he was publicly and falsely charged by
his enemies with having then abjured his opinions; and he was taunted as
a criminal who had been actually punished for his offences. As a
refutation of these calumnies, Cardinal Bellarmine had given him a
certificate in his own handwriting, declaring that he neither abjured
his opinions, nor suffered punishment for them; and that the doctrine of
the earth&rsquo;s motion, and the sun&rsquo;s stability, was only
denounced to him as contrary to Scripture, and as one which could not be
defended. To this certificate the Cardinal did not add, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
he was not called upon to do it, that Galileo was enjoined not <i>to teach
in any manner</i> the doctrine thus denounced; and Galileo ingeniously
avails himself of this supposed omission, to account for his having, in
the lapse of fourteen or sixteen years, forgotten the injunction. He
assigned the same excuse for his having omitted to mention this
injunction to Riccardi, and to the Inquisitor-General at Florence, when
he obtained the licence to print his Dialogues. The court held the
production of this certificate to be at once a proof and an aggravation
of his offence, because the certificate itself declared that the
obnoxious doctrines had been pronounced contrary to the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>Having duly weighed the confessions and excuses of their prisoner, and
considered the general merits of the case, the Inquisition came to an
agreement upon the sentence which they were to pronounce, and appointed
the 22d of June as the day on which it was to be delivered. Two days
previous to this, Galileo was summoned to appear at the holy office; and
on the morning of the 21st, he obeyed the summons. On the 22d of June he
was clothed in a penitential dress, and conducted to the convent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of Minerva, where the Inquisition was assembled to give judgment. A long
and elaborate sentence was pronounced, detailing the former proceedings
of the Inquisition, and specifying the offences which he had committed
in teaching heretical doctrines, in violating his former pledges, and in
obtaining by improper means a license for the printing of his Dialogues.
After an invocation of the name of our Saviour, and of the Holy Virgin,
Galileo is declared to have brought himself under strong suspicions of
heresy, and to have incurred all the censures and penalties which are
enjoined against delinquents of this kind; but from all these
consequences he is to be held absolved, provided that with a sincere
heart, and a faith unfeigned, he abjures and curses the heresies he has
cherished, as well as every other heresy against the Catholic church. In
order that his offence might not go altogether unpunished, that he might
be more cautious in future, and be a warning to others to abstain from
similar delinquencies, it was also decreed that his Dialogues should be
prohibited by public edict; that he himself should be condemned to the
prison of the Inquisition during their pleasure, and that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in the course of the next three years, he should recite once a week the
seven penitential psalms.</p>

<p>The ceremony of Galileo&rsquo;s abjuration was one of exciting interest,
and of awful formality. Clothed in the sackcloth of a repentant
criminal, the venerable sage fell upon his knees before the assembled
Cardinals; and laying his hands upon the Holy Evangelists, he invoked
the Divine aid in abjuring and detesting, and vowing never again to
teach, the doctrine of the earth&rsquo;s motion, and of the sun&rsquo;s
stability. He pledged himself that he would never again, either in words
or in writing, propagate such heresies; and he swore that he would
fulfil and observe the penances which had been inflicted upon him.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
At the conclusion of this ceremony, in which he recited his abjuration
word for word, and then signed it, he was conveyed, in conformity with
his sentence, to the prison of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>The account which we have now given of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the trial and the sentence of Galileo, is pregnant with the deepest
interest and instruction. Human nature is here drawn in its darkest
colouring; and in surveying the melancholy picture, it is difficult to
decide whether religion or philosophy has been most degraded. While we
witness the presumptuous priest pronouncing infallible the decrees of
his own erring judgment, we see the high-minded philosopher abjuring the
eternal and immutable truths which he had himself the glory of
establishing. In the ignorance and prejudices of the age&mdash;in a too
literal interpretation of the language of Scripture&mdash;in a mistaken
respect for the errors that had become venerable from their
antiquity&mdash;and in the peculiar position which Galileo had taken
among the avowed enemies of the church, we may find the elements of an
apology, poor though it be, for the conduct of the Inquisition. But what
excuse can we devise for the humiliating confession and abjuration of
Galileo? Why did this master-spirit of the age&mdash;this high-priest of
the stars&mdash;this representative of science&mdash;this hoary sage,
whose career of glory was near its consummation&mdash;why did he reject
the crown of martyrdom which he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
himself coveted, and which, plaited with immortal laurels, was about to
descend upon his head? If, in place of disavowing the laws of Nature,
and surrendering in his own person the intellectual dignity of his
species, he had boldly asserted the truth of his opinions, and confided
his character to posterity, and his cause to an all-ruling Providence,
he would have strung up the hair-suspended sabre, and disarmed for ever
the hostility which threatened to overwhelm him. The philosopher,
however, was supported only by philosophy; and in the love of truth he
found a miserable substitute for the hopes of the martyr. Galileo
cowered under the fear of man, and his submission was the salvation of
the church. The sword of the Inquisition descended on his prostrate
neck; and though its stroke was not physical, yet it fell with a moral
influence fatal to the character of its victim, and to the dignity of
science.</p>

<p>In studying with attention this portion of scientific history, the
reader will not fail to perceive that the Church of Rome was driven into
a dilemma, from which the submission and abjuration of Galileo could
alone extricate it. He who confesses a crime and denounces its
atrocity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
not only sanctions but inflicts the punishment which is annexed to it.
Had Galileo declared his innocence, and avowed his sentiments, and had
he appealed to the past conduct of the Church itself, to the
acknowledged opinions of its dignitaries, and even to the acts of its
pontiffs, he would have at once confounded his accusers, and escaped
from their toils. After Copernicus, himself a catholic priest, had
<i>openly</i> maintained the motion of the earth, and the stability of the
sun:&mdash;after he had dedicated the work which advocated these
opinions to Pope Paul III., on the express ground that the <i>authority of
the pontiff</i> might silence the calumnies of those who attacked these
opinions by arguments drawn from Scripture:&mdash;after the Cardinal
Schonberg and the Bishop of Culm had urged Copernicus to publish the new
doctrines;&mdash;and after the Bishop of Ermeland had erected a monument
to commemorate his great discoveries;&mdash;how could the Church of Rome
have appealed to its pontifical decrees as the ground of persecuting and
punishing Galileo? Even in later times, the same doctrines had been
propagated with entire toleration: Nay, in the very year of
Galileo&rsquo;s first persecution, Paul Anthony Foscarinus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a learned Carmelite monk, wrote a pamphlet, in which he illustrates and
defends the mobility of the earth, and endeavours to reconcile to this
new doctrine the passages of Scripture which had been employed to
subvert it. This very singular production was dated from the Carmelite
convent at Naples; was dedicated to the very reverend Sebastian Fantoni,
general of the Carmelite order; and, sanctioned by the ecclesiastical
authorities, it was published at Naples in 1615, the very year of the
first persecution of Galileo.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only defence of the Copernican system which issued from
the bosom of the Church. Thomas Campanella, a Calabrian monk, published,
in 1622, &ldquo;<i>An Apology for Galileo</i>,&rdquo; and he even dedicates
it to D. Boniface, Cardinal of Cajeta. Nay, it appears from the
dedication, that he undertook the work at the command of the Cardinal,
and that the examination of the question had been entrusted to the
Cardinal by the Holy Senate. After an able defence of his friend,
Campanella refers, at the conclusion of his apology, to the suppression
of Galileo&rsquo;s writings, and justly observes, that the effect of
such a measure would be to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
make them more generally read, and more highly esteemed. The boldness of
the apologist, however, is wisely tempered with the humility of the
ecclesiastic, and he concludes his work with the declaration, that in
all his opinions, whether written or to be written, he submits himself
to the opinions of the Holy Mother Church of Rome and to the judgment of
his superiors.</p>

<p>By these proceedings of the dignitaries, as well as the clergy of the
Church of Rome, which had been tolerated for more than a century, the
decrees of the pontiffs against the doctrine of the earth&rsquo;s motion
were virtually repealed; and Galileo might have pleaded them with
success in arrest of judgment. Unfortunately, however, for himself and
for science, he acted otherwise. By admitting their authority, he
revived in fresh force these obsolete and obnoxious enactments; and, by
yielding to their power, he riveted for another century the almost
broken chains of spiritual despotism.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact in the annals of heresy and sedition, that opinions
maintained with impunity by one individual, have, in the same age,
brought others to the stake or to the scaffold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
The results of deep research or extravagant speculation seldom provoke
hostility, when meekly announced as the deductions of reason or the
convictions of conscience. As the dreams of a recluse or of an
enthusiast, they may excite pity or call forth contempt; but, like seed
quietly cast into the earth, they will rot and germinate according to
the vitality with which they are endowed. But, if new and startling
opinions are thrown in the face of the community&mdash;if they are
uttered in triumph or in insult&mdash;in contempt of public opinion, or
in derision of cherished errors, they lose the comeliness of truth in
the rancour of their propagation; and they are like seed scattered in a
hurricane, which only irritates and blinds the husbandman. Had Galileo
concluded his <i>System of the World</i> with the quiet peroration of his
apologist Campanella, and dedicated it to the Pope, it might have stood
in the library of the Vatican, beside the cherished though equally
heretical volume of Copernicus.</p>

<p>In the abjuration of his opinions by Galileo, Pope Urban VII. did not
fail to observe the full extent of his triumph; and he exhibited the
utmost sagacity in the means which he employed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to secure it. While he endeavoured to overawe the enemies of the church
by the formal promulgation of Galileo&rsquo;s sentence and abjuration,
and by punishing the officials who had assisted in obtaining the license
to print his work, he treated Galileo with the utmost lenity, and
yielded to every request that was made to diminish, and almost suspend,
the constraint under which he lay. The sentence of abjuration was
ordered to be publicly read at several universities. At Florence the
ceremonial was performed in the church of Santa Croce, and the friends
and disciples of Galileo were especially summoned to witness the public
degradation of their master. The inquisitor at Florence was ordered to
be reprimanded for his conduct; and Riccardi, the master of the sacred
palace, and Ciampoli, the <ins class='corr' title="The original read 'secretry'.">secretary</ins>
of Pope Urban himself, were dismissed from their situations.</p>

<p>Galileo had remained only four days in the prison of the Inquisition,
when, on the application of Niccolini, the Tuscan ambassador, he was
allowed to reside with him in his palace. As Florence still suffered
under the contagious disease which we have already mentioned, it was
proposed that Sienna should be the place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of Galileo&rsquo;s confinement, and that his residence should be in one
of the convents of that city. Niccolini, however, recommended the palace
of the Archbishop Piccolomoni as a more suitable residence; and though
the Archbishop was one of Galileo&rsquo;s best friends, the Pope agreed
to the arrangement, and in the beginning of July Galileo quitted Rome
for Sienna.</p>

<p>After having spent nearly six months under the hospitable roof of his
friend, with no other restraint than that of being confined to the
limits of the palace, Galileo was permitted to return to his villa near
Florence under the same restrictions; and as the contagious disease had
disappeared in Tuscany, he was able in the month of December to re-enter
his own house at Arcetri, where he spent the remainder of his days.</p>

<p>Although Galileo had now the happiness of rejoining his family under
their paternal roof, yet, like all sublunary blessings, it was but of
short duration. His favourite daughter Maria, who along with her sister
had joined the convent of St Matthew in the neighbourhood of Arcetri,
had looked forward to the arrival of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
her father with the most affectionate anticipations. She hoped that her
filial devotion might form some compensation for the malignity of his
enemies, and she eagerly assumed the labour of reciting weekly the seven
penitentiary psalms which formed part of her father&rsquo;s sentence.
These sacred duties, however, were destined to terminate almost at the
moment they were begun. She was seized with a fatal illness in the same
month in which she rejoined her parent, and before the month of April
she was no more. This heavy blow, so suddenly struck, overwhelmed
Galileo in the deepest agony. Owing to the decline of his health, and
the recurrence of his old complaints, he was unable to oppose to this
mental suffering the constitutional energy of his mind. The bulwarks of
his heart broke down, and a flood of grief desolated his manly and
powerful mind. He felt, as he expressed it, that he was incessantly
called by his daughter&mdash;his pulse intermitted&mdash;his heart was
agitated with unceasing palpitations&mdash;his appetite entirely left
him, and he considered his dissolution so near at hand, that he would
not permit his son Vicenzo to set out upon a journey which he had
contemplated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
From this state of melancholy and indisposition, Galileo slowly, though
partially, recovered, and, with the view of obtaining medical
assistance, he requested leave to go to Florence. His enemies, however,
refused this application, and he was given to understand that any
additional importunities would be visited with a more vigilant
surveillance. He remained, therefore, five years at Arcetri, from 1634
to 1638, without any remission of his confinement, and pursuing his
studies under the influence of a continued and general indisposition.</p>

<p>There is no reason to think that Galileo or his friends renewed their
application to the Church of Rome; but, in 1638, the Pope transmitted,
through the Inquisitor Fariano, his permission that he might remove to
Florence for the recovery of his health, on the condition that he should
present himself at the office of the Inquisitor to learn the terms upon
which this indulgence was granted. Galileo accepted of the kindness thus
unexpectedly proffered. But the conditions upon which it was given were
more severe than he expected. He was prohibited from leaving his house
or admitting his friends; and so sternly was this system pursued, that
he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
required a special order for attending mass during passion week.</p>

<p>The severity of this order was keenly felt by Galileo. While he remained
at Arcetri, his seclusion from the world would have been an object of
choice, if it had not been the decree of a tribunal; but to be debarred
from the conversation of his friends in Florence&mdash;in that city where his
genius had been idolised, and where his fame had become immortal, was an
aggravation of punishment which he was unable to bear. With his
accustomed kindness, the Grand Duke made a strong representation on the
subject to his ambassador at the Court of Rome. He stated that, from his
great age and infirmities, Galileo&rsquo;s career was near its close;
that he possessed many valuable ideas, which the world might lose if
they were not matured and conveyed to his friends; and that Galileo was
anxious to make these communications to Father Castelli, who was then a
stipendiary of the Court of Rome. The Grand Duke commanded his
ambassador to see Castelli on the subject&mdash;to urge him to obtain leave
from the Pope to spend a few months in Florence&mdash;and to supply him with
money and every thing that was necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
for his journey. Influenced by this kind and liberal message, Castelli
obtained an audience of the Pope, and requested leave to pay a visit to
Florence. Urban instantly suspected the object of his journey; and, upon
Castelli&rsquo;s acknowledging that he could not possibly refrain from
seeing Galileo, he received permission to visit him in the company of an
officer of the Inquisition. Castelli accordingly went to Florence, and,
a few months afterwards, Galileo was ordered to return to Arcetri.</p>

<p>During Galileo&rsquo;s confinement at Sienna and Arcetri, between 1633
and 1638, his time was principally occupied in the composition of his
&ldquo;Dialogues on Local Motion,&rdquo; in which he treats of the
strength and cohesion of solid bodies, of the laws of uniform and
accelerated motions, of the motion of projectiles, and of the centre of
gravity of solids. This remarkable work, which was considered by its
author as the best of his productions, was printed by Louis Elzevir, at
Amsterdam, and dedicated to the Count de Noailles, the French ambassador
at Rome. Various attempts to have it printed in Germany had failed; and,
in order to save himself from the malignity of his enemies, he was
obliged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to pretend that the edition published in Holland had been printed from a
MS. entrusted to the French ambassador.</p>

<p>Although Galileo had for a long time abandoned his astronomical studies,
yet his attention was directed, about the year 1636, to a curious
appearance in the lunar disc, which is known by the name of the
moon&rsquo;s libration. When we examine with a telescope the outline of
the moon, we observe that certain parts of her disc, which are seen at
one time, are invisible at another. This change or libration is of four
different kinds, viz. the diurnal libration, the libration in longitude,
the libration in latitude, and the spheroidal libration. Galileo
discovered the first of these kinds of libration, and appears to have
had some knowledge of the second; but the third was discovered by
Hevelius, and the fourth by Lagrange.</p>

<p>This curious discovery was the result of the last telescopic
observations of Galileo. Although his right eye had for some years lost
its power, yet his general vision was sufficiently perfect to enable him
to carry on his usual researches. In 1636, however, this affection of
his eye became more serious; and, in 1637, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
left eye was attacked with the same disease. His medical friends at
first supposed that cataracts were formed in the crystalline lens, and
anticipated a cure from the operation of couching. These hopes were
fallacious. The disease turned out to be in the cornea, and every
attempt to restore its transparency was fruitless. In a few months the
white cloud covered the whole aperture of the pupil, and Galileo became
totally blind. This sudden and unexpected calamity had almost
overwhelmed Galileo and his friends. In writing to a correspondent he
exclaims, &ldquo;Alas! your dear friend and servant has become totally
and irreparably blind. These heavens, this earth, this universe, which
by wonderful observation I had enlarged a thousand times beyond the
belief of past ages, are henceforth shrunk into the narrow space which I
myself occupy. So it pleases God; it shall, therefore, please me
also.&rdquo; His friend, Father Castelli, deplores the calamity in the
same tone of pathetic sublimity:&mdash;&ldquo;The noblest eye,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;which nature ever made, is darkened; an eye so
privileged, and gifted with such rare powers, that it may truly be said
to have seen more than the eyes of all that are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
gone, and to have opened the eyes of all that are to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although Galileo had been thwarted in his attempt to introduce into the
Spanish marine his new method of finding the longitude at sea, yet he
never lost sight of an object to which he attached the highest
importance. As the formation of correct tables of the motion of
Jupiter&rsquo;s satellites was a necessary preliminary to its
introduction, he had occupied himself for twenty-four years in
observations for this purpose, and he had made considerable progress in
this laborious task. After the publication of his &ldquo;Dialogues on
Motion,&rdquo; in 1636, he renewed his attempts to bring his method into
actual use. For this purpose he addressed himself to Lorenzo Real, who
had been the Dutch Governor-General in India, and offered the free use
of his method to the States-General of Holland.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
The Dutch government received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
this proposal with an anxious desire to have it carried into effect. At
the instigation of Constantine Huygens, the father of the illustrious
Huygens, and the secretary to the Prince of Orange, they appointed
commissioners to communicate with Galileo; and while they transmitted
him a gold chain as a mark of their esteem, they at the same time
assured him, that if his plan should prove successful it should not pass
unrewarded. The commissioners entered into an active correspondence with
Galileo, and had even appointed one of their number to communicate
personally with him in Italy. Lest this, however, should excite the
jealousy of the court of Rome, Galileo objected to the arrangement, so
that the negociation was carried on solely by correspondence.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Galileo was struck with blindness. His friend
and pupil, Renieri, undertook in this emergency to arrange and complete
his observations and calculations; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
before he had made much progress in the arduous task, each of the four
commissioners died in succession, and it was with great difficulty that
Constantine Huygens succeeded in renewing the scheme. It was again
obstructed, however, by the death of Galileo; and when Renieri was about
to publish, by the order of the Grand Duke, the &ldquo;Ephemeris,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Tables of the Jovian Planets,&rdquo; he was attacked with a
mortal disease, and the manuscripts of Galileo, which he was on the eve
of publishing, were never more heard of. By such a series of misfortunes
were the plans of Galileo and of the States-General completely
overthrown. It is some consolation, however, to know that neither
science nor navigation suffered any severe loss. Notwithstanding the
perfection of our present tables of Jupiter&rsquo;s satellites, and of
the astronomical instruments by which their eclipses may be observed,
the method of Galileo is still impracticable at sea.</p>

<p>In consequence of the strict seclusion to which Galileo had been
subjected, he was in the practice of dating his letters from his prison
at Arcetri; but after he had lost the use of his eyes, the Inquisition
seems to have relaxed its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
severity, and to have allowed him the freest intercourse with his
friends. The Grand Duke of Tuscany paid him frequent visits; and among
the celebrated strangers who came from distant lands to see the ornament
of Italy, were Gassendi, Deodati, and our illustrious countryman Milton.
During the last three years of his life, his eminent pupil Viviani
formed one of his family; and in October 1641, the celebrated
Torricelli, another of his pupils, was admitted to the same distinction.</p>

<p>Though the powerful mind of Galileo still retained its vigour, yet his
debilitated frame was exhausted with mental labour. He often complained
that his head was too busy for his body; and the continuity of his
studies was frequently broken with attacks of hypochondria, want of
sleep, and acute rheumatic pains. Along with these calamities, he was
afflicted with another still more severe&mdash;with deafness almost total;
but though he was now excluded from all communication with the external
world, yet his mind still grappled with the material universe, and while
he was studying the force of percussion, and preparing for a
continuation of his &ldquo;Dialogues on Motion,&rdquo; he was attacked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
with fever and palpitation of the heart, which, after continuing two
months, terminated fatally on the 8th of January 1642, in the 78th year
of his age.</p>

<p>Having died in the character of a prisoner of the Inquisition, this
odious tribunal disputed his right of making a will, and of being buried
in consecrated ground. These objections, however, were withdrawn; but
though a large sum was subscribed for erecting a monument to him in the
church of Santa Croce, in Florence, the Pope would not permit the design
to be carried into execution. His sacred remains were, therefore,
deposited in an obscure corner of the church, and remained for more than
thirty years unmarked with any monumental tablet. The following epitaph,
given without any remark in the Leyden edition of his Dialogues, is, we
presume, the one which was inscribed on a tablet in the church of Santa
Croce:&mdash;</p>

<p>At his death, in 1703, Viviani purchased his property, with the charge
of erecting a monument over Galileo&rsquo;s remains and his own.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
This design was not carried into effect till 1737, at the expense of the
family of Nelli, when both their bodies were disinterred, and removed to
the site of the splendid monument which now covers them. This monument
contains the bust of Galileo, with figures of Geometry and Astronomy. It
was designed by Giulio Foggini. Galileo&rsquo;s bust was executed by
Giovanni Battista Foggini; the figure of Astronomy by Vincenzio Foggini,
his son; and that of Geometry by Girolamo Ticciati.</p>

<p>Galileo&rsquo;s house at Arcetri still remains. In 1821 it belonged to
one Signor Alimari, having been preserved in the state in which it was
left by Galileo; it stands very near the convent of St Matthew, and
about a mile to the S. E. of Florence. An inscription by Nelli, over the
door of the house, still remains.</p>

<p>The character of Galileo, whether we view him as a member of the social
circle, or as a man of science, presents many interesting and
instructive points of contemplation. Unfortunate, and to a certain
extent immoral, in his domestic relations, he did not derive from that
hallowed source all the enjoyments which it generally yields; and it was
owing to this cause,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
perhaps, that he was more fond of society than might have been expected
from his studious habits. His habitual cheerfulness and gaiety, and his
affability and frankness of manner, rendered him an universal favourite
among his friends. Without any of the pedantry of exclusive talent, and
without any of that ostentation which often marks the man of limited
though profound acquirements, Galileo never conversed upon scientific or
philosophical subjects except among those who were capable of
understanding them. The extent of his general information, indeed, his
great literary knowledge, but, above all, his retentive memory, stored
with the legends and the poetry of ancient times, saved him from the
necessity of drawing upon his own peculiar studies for the topics of his
conversation.</p>

<p>Galileo was not less distinguished for his hospitality and benevolence;
he was liberal to the poor, and generous in the aid which he
administered to men of genius and talent, who often found a comfortable
asylum under his roof. In his domestic economy he was frugal without
being parsimonious. His hospitable board was ever ready for the
reception of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
friends; and, though he was himself abstemious in his diet, he seems to
have been a lover of good wines, of which he received always the
choicest varieties out of the Grand Duke&rsquo;s cellar. This peculiar
taste, together with his attachment to a country life, rendered him fond
of agricultural pursuits, and induced him to devote his leisure hours to
the cultivation of his vineyards.</p>

<p>In his personal appearance Galileo was about the middle size, and of a
square-built, but well-proportioned, frame. His complexion was fair, his
eyes penetrating, and his hair of a reddish hue. His expression was
cheerful and animated, and though his temper was easily ruffled, yet the
excitement was transient, and the cause of it speedily forgotten.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent traits in the character of Galileo was his
invincible love of truth, and his abhorrence of that spiritual despotism
which had so long brooded over Europe. His views, however, were too
liberal, and too far in advance of the age which he adorned; and however
much we may admire the noble spirit which he evinced, and the personal
sacrifices which he made, in his struggle for truth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
we must yet lament the hotness of his zeal and the temerity of his
onset. In his contest with the Church of Rome, he fell under her
victorious banner; and though his cause was that of truth, and hers that
of superstition, yet the sympathy of Europe was not roused by his
misfortunes. Under the sagacious and peaceful sway of Copernicus,
astronomy had effected a glorious triumph over the dogmas of the Church;
but under the bold and uncompromising sceptre of Galileo all her
conquests were irrecoverably lost.</p>

<p>The scientific character of Galileo, and his method of investigating
truth, demand our warmest admiration. The number and ingenuity of his
inventions, the brilliant discoveries which he made in the heavens, and
the depth and beauty of his researches respecting the laws of motion,
have gained him the admiration of every succeeding age, and have placed
him next to Newton in the lists of original and inventive genius. To
this high rank he was doubtless elevated by the inductive processes
which he followed in all his inquiries. Under the sure guidance of
observation and experiment, he advanced to general laws; and if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Bacon had never lived, the student of nature Would have found, in the
writings and labours of Galileo, not only the boasted principles of the
inductive philosophy, but also their practical application to the
highest efforts of invention and discovery.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Among the distinguished men who were destined to revive the sciences,
and to establish the true system of the universe, Tycho Brahe holds a
conspicuous place. He was born on the 14th December 1546, at Knudstorp,
the estate of his ancestors, which is situated near Helsingborg, in
Scania, and was the eldest son and the second child of a family of five
sons and five daughters. His father, Otto Brahe, who was descended from
a noble Swedish family, was in such straitened circumstances, that he
resolved to educate his sons for the military profession; but Tycho
seems to have disliked the choice that was made for him; and his next
brother, Steno, who appears to have had a similar feeling, exchanged the
sword for the more peaceful occupation of Privy Councillor to the King.
The rest of his brothers, though of senatorial rank, do not seem to have
extended the renown of their family; but their youngest sister, Sophia,
is represented as an accomplished mathematician, and is said to have
devoted her mind to astronomy as well as to the astrological reveries of
the age.</p>

<p>George Brahe, the brother of Otto, having no children of his own,
resolved to adopt and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
educate one of his nephews. On the birth of Tycho, accordingly, he was
desirous of having him placed under his wife&rsquo;s care; but his
parents could not be prevailed upon to part with their child till after
the birth of Steno, their second son.</p>

<p>Having been instructed in reading and writing under proper masters,
Tycho began the study of Latin in his seventh year; and, in opposition
to his father&rsquo;s views, he prosecuted it for five years under
private teachers, from whom he received also occasional instruction in
poetry and the belles lettres.</p>

<p>In April 1559, about three years after his father&rsquo;s death, Tycho
was sent to the University of Copenhagen, to study rhetoric and
philosophy, with the view of preparing for the study of the law, and
qualifying himself for some of those political offices which his rank
entitled him to expect. In this situation he contracted no fondness for
any particular study; but after he had been sixteen months at college,
an event occurred which directed all the powers of his mind to the
science of astronomy. The attention of the public had been long fixed on
a great eclipse of the sun, which was to happen on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
21st August 1560; and as in those days a phenomenon of this kind was
linked with the destinies of nations as well as of individuals, the
interest which it excited was as intense as it was general. Tycho
watched its arrival with peculiar anxiety. He read the astrological
diaries of the day, in which its phases and its consequences were
described; and when he saw the sun darkened at the very moment that had
been predicted, and to the very extent that had been delineated, he
resolved to make himself master of a science which was capable of
predicting future events, and especially that branch of it which
connected these events with the fortunes and destinies of man. With this
view he purchased the <i>Tabul&aelig; Bergenses</i>, calculated by John
Stadius, and began with ardour the study of the planetary motions.</p>

<p>When Tycho had completed his course at Copenhagen, he was sent, in
February 1562, under the charge of a tutor to study jurisprudence at
Leipsic. Astronomy, however, engrossed all his thoughts; and he had no
sooner escaped from the daily surveillance of his master, than he rushed
with headlong impetuosity into his favourite pursuits. With his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
pocket money he purchased astronomical books, which he read in secret;
and by means of a celestial globe, the size of his fist, he made himself
acquainted with the stars, and followed them night after night through
the heavens, when sleep had lulled the vigilance of his preceptor. By
means of the Ephemerides of Stadius, he learned to distinguish the
planets, and to trace them through their direct and retrograde
movements; and having obtained the Alphonsine and Prutenic Tables, and
compared his own calculations and observations with those of Stadius, he
observed great differences in the results, and from that moment he seems
to have conceived the design of devoting his life to the accurate
construction of tables, which he justly regarded as the basis of
astronomy.</p>

<p>With this view, he applied himself secretly to the study of arithmetic
and geometry; and, without the assistance of a master, he acquired that
mathematical knowledge which enabled him to realise these early
aspirations. His ardour for astronomy was still farther inflamed, and
the resolution which it inspired still farther strengthened, by the
great conjunction of Jupiter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and Saturn, which took place in August 1563. The calculated time of this
phenomenon differed considerably from the true time which was observed;
and in determining the instant of conjunction Tycho felt in the
strongest manner the imperfection of the instruments which he used. For
this purpose he employed a sort of compass, one leg of which was
directed to one planet and the second to the other planet or fixed star;
and, by measuring the angular opening between them, he determined the
distance of the two celestial bodies. By this rude contrivance he found
that the Alphonsine Tables erred a whole month in the time of
conjunction, while the Copernican ones were at least several days in
error. To this celebrated conjunction Tycho ascribed the great plague
which in subsequent years desolated Europe, because it took place in the
beginning of <i>Leo</i>, and not far from the nebulous stars of <i>Cancer</i>, two
of the zodiacal signs which are reckoned by Ptolemy &ldquo;suffocating
and pestilent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There dwelt at this time at Leipsic an ingenious artisan named
Scultetus, who was employed by Homelius, the professor of mathematics in
that city, to assist him in the construction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of his instruments. Having become acquainted with this young man, Tycho
put into his hand a wooden radius, such as was recommended by Gemma
Frisius, for the purpose of having it divided in the manner adopted by
Homelius; and with this improved instrument he made a great number of
astronomical observations out of his window, without ever exciting the
suspicions of his tutor.</p>

<p>Having spent three years at Leipsic, he was about to make the tour of
Germany, when, in consequence of his uncle&rsquo;s death, he was
summoned to his native country to inherit the fortune which had been
left him. He accordingly quitted Leipsic about the middle of May 1565,
and after having arranged his domestic concerns in Denmark, he continued
his astronomical observations with the radius constructed for him by
Scultetus. The ardour with which he pursued his studies gave great
umbrage to his friends as well as to his relations. He was reproached
for having abandoned the profession of the law; his astronomical
observations were ridiculed as not only useless but degrading, and,
among his numerous connexions, his maternal uncle, Steno Bille, was the
only one who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
applauded him for following the bent of his genius. Under these
uncomfortable circumstances he resolved to quit his country, and pay a
visit to the most interesting cities of Germany.</p>

<p>At Wittemberg, where he arrived in April 1566, he resumed his
astronomical observations; but, in consequence of the plague having
broken out in that city, he removed to Rostoch in the following autumn.
Here an accident occurred which had nearly deprived him of his life. On
the 10th December he was invited to a wedding feast; and, among other
guests, there was present a noble countryman of his own, Manderupius
Pasbergius. Some difference having arisen between them on this occasion,
they parted with feelings of mutual displeasure. On the 27th of the same
month they met again at some festive games, and having revived their
former quarrel, they agreed to settle their differences by the sword.
They accordingly met at 7 o&rsquo;clock in the evening of the 29th, and
fought in total darkness. In this blind combat, Manderupius cut off the
whole of the front of Tycho&rsquo;s nose, and it was fortunate for
astronomy that his more valuable organs were defended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
by so faithful an outpost. The quarrel, which is said to have originated
in a difference of opinion respecting their mathematical acquirements,
terminated here; and Tycho repaired his loss by cementing upon his face
a nose of gold and silver, which is said to have formed a good imitation
of the original.</p>

<p>During the years 1567 and 1568, Tycho continued to reside at Rostoch,
with the exception of a few months, during which he made a rapid journey
into Denmark. He lived in a house in the college of the Jesuits, which
he had rented on account of its fitness for celestial observations; but,
though he intended to spend the winter under its roof, he had made no
arrangement respecting his future life, leaving it, as he said, in the
hands of Providence. A desire, however, to visit the south of Germany
induced him to quit Rostoch, and having crossed the Danube, he paid a
visit to Augsburg.</p>

<p>Upon entering this ancient city, Tycho was particularly struck with the
grandeur of its fortifications, the splendour of its private houses, and
the beauty of its fountains; and, after a short residence within its
walls, he was still more delighted with the industry of the people,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the refinement of the higher classes, and the love of literature and
science which was cherished by its wealthy citizens. Among the
interesting acquaintances which he formed at Augsburg, were two
brothers, John and Paul Hainzel, the one a septemvir, and the other the
consul or burgomaster. They were both distinguished by their learning,
and both of them, particularly Paul, were ardent lovers of astronomy.
Tycho had hitherto no other astronomical instrument than the coarse
radius which was made for him by Scultetus, and he waited only for a
proper occasion to have a larger and better instrument constructed for
his use. Having now the command of workmen who could execute his plans,
he conceived the bold design of making a divided instrument which should
distinctly exhibit single minutes of a degree. While he was transferring
the first rude conception of his instrument to paper, Paul Hainzel
entered his study, and was so struck with the grandeur of the plan, that
he instantly undertook to have it executed at his own expense. The
projected instrument was a quadrant of fourteen cubits radius! and Tycho
and his friend entered upon its construction with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
that intense ardour which is ever crowned with success.</p>

<p>In the village of Gegginga, about half a mile to the south of the city,
Paul Hainzel had a country house, the garden of which was chosen as the
spot where the quadrant was to be fixed. The best artists in Augsburg,
clockmakers, jewellers, smiths, and carpenters, were engaged to execute
the work, and from the zeal which so novel an instrument inspired, the
quadrant was completed in less than a month. Its size was so great that
twenty men could with difficulty transport it to its place of fixture.
The two principal rectangular radii were beams of oak; the arch which
lay between their extremities was made of solid wood of a particular
kind, and the whole was bound together by twelve beams. It received
additional strength from several iron bands, and the arch was covered
with plates of brass, for the purpose of receiving the 5400 divisions
into which it was to be subdivided. A large and strong pillar of oak,
shod with iron, was driven into the ground, and kept in its place by
solid mason work. To this pillar the quadrant was fixed in a vertical
plane, and steps were prepared to elevate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the observer, when stars of a low altitude required his attention. As
the instrument could not be conveniently covered with a roof, it was
protected from the weather by a covering made of skins, but
notwithstanding this and other precautions, it was broken to pieces by a
violent storm, after having remained uninjured for the space of five
years.</p>

<p>As this quadrant was fitted only to determine the altitudes of the
celestial bodies, Tycho constructed a large sextant for the purpose of
measuring their distances. It consisted of two radii, which opened and
shut round a centre, and which were nearly four cubits long, and also of
two arches, one of which was graduated, while the other served to keep
the radii in the same plane. After the radii had been opened or shut
till they nearly comprehended the angle between the stars to be
observed, the adjustment was completed by means of a very fine tangent
screw. With this instrument Tycho made many excellent observations
during his stay at Augsburg. He began also the construction of a wooden
globe about six feet in diameter. Its outer surface was turned with
great accuracy into a sphere, and kept from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
warping by interior bars of wood supported at its centre.</p>

<p>After receiving a visit from the celebrated Peter Ramus, who
subsequently fell a victim at the massacre of St Bartholomew, Tycho left
Augsburg, having received a promise from his friend Hainzel that he
would communicate to him the observations made with his large quadrant,
and with the sextant which he had given him in a present. He paid a
visit to Philip Appian in passing through Ingolstadt, and returned to
his native country about the end of 1571.</p>

<p>The fame which he had acquired as an astronomer procured for him a
warmer reception than that which he had formerly experienced. The King
invited him to court, and his friends and admirers loaded him with
kindness. His uncle, Steno Bille, who now lived at the ancient convent
of Herritzvold, and who had always taken a deep interest in the
scientific character of his nephew, not only invited him to his house,
but assigned to him for an observatory the part of it which was best
adapted for that purpose. Tycho cheerfully accepted of this liberal
offer. The immediate proximity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Herritzvold to Knudstorp, rendered this arrangement peculiarly
convenient, and in the house of his uncle he experienced all that
kindness and consideration which natural affection and a love of science
combined to cherish. When Steno learned that the study of chemistry was
one of the pursuits of his nephew, he granted him a spacious house, a
few yards distant from the convent, for his laboratory. Tycho lost no
time in fitting up his observatory, and in providing his furnaces; and
regarding gold and silver and the other metals as the stars of the
earth, he used to represent his two opposite pursuits as forming only
one science, namely, celestial and terrestrial astronomy.</p>

<p>In the hopes of enriching himself by the pursuits of alchemy, Tycho
devoted most of his attention to those satellites of gold and silver
which now constituted his own system, and which disturbed by their
powerful action the hitherto uniform movements of their primary. His
affections were ever turning to Germany, where astronomers of kindred
views, and artists of surpassing talent were to be found in almost every
city. The want of money alone prevented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
him from realizing his wishes; and it was in the hope of attaining the
means of travelling, that he in a great measure forsook his sextants for
his crucibles. In order, however, that he might have one good instrument
in his observatory, he constructed a sextant similar to, but somewhat
larger than, that which he had presented to Hainzel. Its limb was made
of solid brass, and was exquisitely divided into single minutes of a
degree. Its radii were strengthened with plates of brass, and the
apparatus for opening and shutting them was made with great accuracy.</p>

<p>The possession of this instrument was peculiarly fortunate for Tycho,
for an event now occurred which roused him from his golden visions, and
directed all his faculties into their earlier and purer current. On the
11th November 1572, when he was returning to supper from his laboratory,
the clearness of the sky inspired him with the desire of completing some
particular observations. On looking up to the starry firmament he was
surprised to see an extraordinary light in the constellation of
Cassiopeia, which was then above his head. He felt confident that he had
never before observed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
such a star in that constellation, and distrusting the evidence of his
own senses, he called out the servants and the peasants, and having
received their testimony that it was a huge star such as they had never
seen before, he was satisfied of the correctness of his own vision.
Regarding it as a new and unusual phenomenon, he hastened to his
observatory, adjusted his sextant, and measured its distances from the
nearest stars in Cassiopeia. He noted also its form, its magnitude, its
light, and its colour, and he waited with great anxiety for the next
night that he might determine the important point whether it was a fixed
star, or a body within, or near to, our own system.</p>

<p>For several years Tycho had been in the practice of calculating, at the
beginning of each year, a sort of almanac for his own use, and in this
he inserted all the observations which he had made on the new star, and
the conclusions which he had drawn from them. Having gone to Copenhagen
in the course of the ensuing spring, he shewed this manuscript to John
Pratensis, a Professor, in whose house he was always hospitably
received. Charles Danzeus, the French ambassador, and a person of great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
learning, having heard of Tycho&rsquo;s arrival, invited himself to dine
with him at the house of Pratensis. The conversation soon turned upon
the new star, and Tycho found his companion very sceptical about its
existence. Danzeus was particularly jocular on the subject, and attacked
the Danes for their inattention to so important a science as astronomy.
Tycho received this lecture in good temper, and with the anxious
expectation that a clear sky would enable him to give a practical
refutation of the attack which was made upon his country. The night
turned out serene, and the whole party saw with astonishment the new
star under the most favourable circumstances. Pratensis conceived that
it was similar to the one observed by Hipparchus, and urged Tycho to
publish the observations which he had made upon it. Tycho refused to
accede to this request, on the pretext that his work was not
sufficiently perfect; but the true reason, as he afterwards
acknowledged, was, that he considered it would be a disgrace for a
nobleman, either to study such subjects, or to communicate them to the
public. This absurd notion was with some difficulty overcome, and
through the earnest entreaties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and assistance of Pratensis, his work on the new star was published in
1573.</p>

<p>This remarkable body presents to us one of the most interesting
phenomena in astronomy. The date of its first appearance has not been
exactly ascertained. Tycho saw it on the 11th November, but Cornelius
Gemma had seen it on the 9th, Paul Hainzel saw it on the 7th of August
at Augsburg, and Wolfgangus Schulerus observed it at Wittenberg on the
6th. Tycho conjectures that it was first seen on the 5th, and Hieronymus
Munosius asserts that at Valentia, in Spain, it was not seen on the 2d,
when he was shewing that part of the heavens to his pupils. This
singular body continued to be seen during 16 months, and did not
disappear till March 1574. In its appearance it was exactly like a star,
having none of the distinctive marks of a comet. It twinkled strongly,
and grew larger than <i>Lyra</i> or <i>Sirius</i>, or any other fixed star. It
seemed to be somewhat larger than <i>Jupiter</i>, when he is nearest the
earth, and rivalled <i>Venus</i> in her greatest brightness. In the <i>first</i>
month of its appearance it was less than Jupiter; in the <i>second</i> it
equalled him; in the <i>third</i> it surpassed him in splendour; in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the <i>fourth</i> it was equal to <i>Sirius</i>; in the <i>fifth</i> to <i>Lyra</i>; in the
<i>sixth</i> and <i>seventh</i> to stars of the <i>second</i> magnitude; in the
<i>eighth</i>, <i>ninth</i>, and <i>tenth</i>, to stars of the <i>third</i> magnitude; in
the <i>eleventh</i>, <i>twelfth</i>, and <i>thirteenth</i>, to stars of the <i>fourth</i>
magnitude; in the <i>fourteenth</i> and <i>fifteenth</i> to stars of the <i>fifth</i>
magnitude; and in the <i>sixteenth</i> month to stars of the <i>sixth</i>
magnitude. After this it became so small that it at last disappeared.
Its colour changed also with its size. At first it was white and bright;
in the third month it began to become yellowish; in the fifth it became
reddish like Aldebaran; and in the seventh and eighth it became bluish
like Saturn; growing afterwards duller and duller. Its place in the
heavens was invariable. Its longitude was in the 6th degree and 54th
minute of Taurus; and its latitude 53&deg; 45&acute; north. Its right
ascension was 0&deg; 26&#8534;&acute; and its declination 61&deg;
46&frac34;&acute;. It had no parallax, and was unquestionably situated in
the region of the fixed stars.</p>

<p>After Tycho had published his book, he proposed to travel into Germany
and Italy, but he was seized with a fever, and he had no sooner
recovered from it, than he became involved in a love affair, which
frustrated all his schemes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Although Tycho was afraid of casting a stain upon his nobility by
publishing his observations on the new star, yet he did not scruple to
debase his lineage by marrying a peasant girl of the village of
Knudstorp. This event took place in 1573, and in 1574 his wife gave
birth to his daughter Magdalene. Tycho&rsquo;s noble relations were
deeply offended at this imprudent step; and so far did the mutual
animosity of the parties extend, that the King himself was obliged to
effect a reconciliation.</p>

<p>The fame of our author as an astronomer and mathematician was now so
high, that several young Danish nobles requested him to deliver a course
of lectures upon these interesting subjects. This application was
seconded by Pratensis, Danzeus, and all his best friends; but their
solicitations were vain. The King at last made the request in a way
which ensured its being granted, and Tycho delivered a course of
lectures, in which he not only gave a full view of the science of
astronomy, but defended and explained all the reveries of astrology.</p>

<p>Having finished his lectures, and arranged his domestic affairs, he set
out on his projected journey about the beginning of the spring of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
1575, leaving behind him his wife and daughter, till he should fix upon
a place of permanent residence. The first town which he visited was
Hesse-Cassel, <ins class="corr" title="The original read 'there sidence'.">the residence</ins>
of William, Landgrave of Hesse, whose patronage of astronomy, and whose
skill in making celestial observations, have immortalized his name. Here
Tycho spent eight or ten delightful days, during which the two
astronomers were occupied one half of the day in scientific
conversation, and the other half in astronomical observations; and he
would have prolonged a visit which gave him so much pleasure, had not
the death of one of the Landgrave&rsquo;s daughters interrupted their
labours. Passing through Frankfort, Tycho went into Switzerland; and,
after visiting many cities on his way, he fixed upon Basle as a place of
residence, not only from its centrical position, but from the salubrity
of the air, and the cheapness of living. From Switzerland he went to
Venice, and, in returning through Germany, he came to Ratisbon, at the
time of the congress, which had been called together on the 1st of
November, for the coronation of the Emperor Rudolph. On this occasion he
met with several distinguished individuals, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
were not only skilled in astronomy, but who were among its warmest
patrons. From Ratisbon he passed to Saalfeld, and thence to Wittemburg,
where he saw the parallactic instruments and the wooden quadrant which
had been used by John Pratensis in determining the latitude of the city,
and in measuring the altitudes of the new star.</p>

<p>Tycho was now impatient for home, and he lost no time in returning to
Denmark, where events were awaiting him which frustrated all his
schemes, by placing him in the most favourable situation for promoting
his own happiness, and advancing the interests of astronomy.</p>

<p>The patronage which had been extended to astronomers by several of the
reigning princes of Germany, especially by the Landgrave of Hesse, and
Augustus, Elector of Saxony, had begun to excite a love of science in
the minds of other sovereigns. The King of Denmark seems to have felt it
as a stain upon his character, that the only astronomer in his dominions
should carry on his observations in distant kingdoms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and adorn by his discoveries other courts than his own. With this
feeling he sent ambassadors to Hesse-Cassel to inquire after Tycho, and
to intimate to him his wish that he should return to Denmark, and his
anxiety to promote the advancement of astronomy in his own dominions.
Tycho had left Cassel when these messengers arrived, and had heard
nothing of the King&rsquo;s intentions till he was about to quit
Knudstorp with his family for Basle. At this time he was surprised at
the arrival of a noble messenger, who brought a letter requesting him to
meet the King as soon as possible at Copenhagen. Tycho lost no time in
obeying the royal summons. The King received him with the most
flattering kindness. He offered to give him a grant for life of the
island of Huen, between Denmark and Sweden, and to construct and furnish
with instruments, at his own expense, an observatory, as well as a house
for the accommodation of his family, together with a laboratory for
carrying on his chemical inquiries. Tycho, who truly loved his country,
was deeply affected with the munificence of the royal offer. He accepted
of it with that warmth of gratitude which it was calculated to
inspire;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and he particularly rejoiced in the thought that if any success should
attend his future labours, the glory of it would belong to his native
land.</p>

<p>The island of Huen is about sxix miles from the coast of Zealand, three
from that of Sweden, and fourteen from Copenhagen. It is six miles in
circumference, and rises into the form of a mountain, which, though very
high, terminates in a plain. It is nowhere rocky, and even in the time
of Tycho it produced the best kinds of grain, afforded excellent
pasturage for horses, cattle, and sheep, and possessed deer, hares,
rabbits, and partridges in abundance. It contained at that time only one
village, with about forty inhabitants.</p>

<p>Having surveyed his new territory, Tycho resolved to build a magnificent
tower in the centre of the elevated plain, which he resolved to call
Uraniburg, or <i>The City of the Heavens</i>. Having made the necessary
arrangements, he repaired to the island on the 8th of August, and his
friend Charles Danzeus laid the foundation stone of the new observatory,
which consisted of a slab of porphyry, with the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot sc sf75"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>

<p>This ceremony was performed early in the morning of a splendid day, in
which the rising sun threw its blessing upon Frederick, and upon the
party of noblemen and philosophers who had assembled to testify their
love of science. An entertainment was provided for the occasion, and
copious libations of a variety of wines were offered for the success of
the undertaking.</p>

<p>The observatory was surrounded by a rampart, each face of which was
three hundred feet long. About the middle of each face the rampart
became a semicircle, the inner diameter of which was ninety feet. The
height of the rampart was twenty-two feet, and its thickness at the base
twenty. Its four angles corresponded exactly with the four cardinal
points,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and at the north and south angles were erected turrets, of which one was
a printing-house, and the other the residence of the servants. Gates
were erected at the east and west angles, and above them were apartments
for the reception of strangers. Within the rampart was a shrubbery with
about three hundred varieties of trees; and at the centre of each
semicircular part of the rampart was a bower or summer-house. This
shrubbery surrounded the flower-garden, which was terminated within by a
circular wall about forty-five feet high, which enclosed a more elevated
area, in the centre of which stood the principal building in the
observatory, and from which four paths led to the above-mentioned
angles, with as many doors for entering the garden.</p>

<p>The principal building was about sixty feet square. The doors were
placed on the east and west sides; and to the north and south fronts
were attached two round towers, whose inner diameter was about
thirty-two feet, and which formed the observatories which had windows in
their roof, that could be opened towards any part of the heavens. The
accommodations for the family were numerous and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
splendid. Under the observatory, in the south tower, was the museum and
library, and below this again was the laboratory in a subterraneous
crypt, containing sixteen furnaces of various kinds. Beneath this was a
well forty feet deep, from which water was distributed by syphons to
every part of the building.</p>

<p>Besides the principal building there were other two situated without the
rampart, one to the north, containing a workshop for the construction of
astronomical and other instruments, and the other to the south, which
was occupied as a sort of farm-house. These buildings cost the King of
Denmark 100,000 rix-dollars (&pound;20,000), and Tycho is said to have
expended upon them a similar sum.</p>

<p>As the two towers could not accommodate the instruments which Tycho
required for his observations, he found it necessary to erect, on the
hill about sixty paces to the south of Uraniburg, a subterranean
observatory, in which he might place his larger instruments, which
required to be firmly fixed, and to be protected from the wind and the
weather. This observatory, which he called Stiern-berg, or the mountain,
of the stars, consisted of several crypts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
separated by solid walls, and to these there was a subterranean passage
from the laboratory in Uraniburg. The various buildings which Tycho
erected were built in a regular style of architecture, and were highly
ornamented, not only with external decorations, but with the statues and
pictures of the most distinguished astronomers, from Hipparchus and
Ptolemy down to Copernicus, and with inscriptions and poems in honour of
astronomers.</p>

<p>While these buildings were erecting, and after their completion, Tycho
was busily occupied in preparing instruments for observation. These were
of the most splendid description, and the reader will form some notion
of their grandeur and their expense from the following list:&mdash;</p>

<li>28. A small brass astrolabe.</li></ul>
</div>

<p>In almost all the instruments now enumerated, the limb was subdivided by
diagonal lines, a method which Tycho first brought into use, but which,
in modern times, has been superseded by the inventions of Nonius and
Vernier.</p>

<p>When Tycho had thus furnished his observatory, he devoted himself to the
examination of the stars; and during the twenty-one years which he spent
in this delightful occupation, he made vast additions to astronomical
science. In order to instruct the young in the art of observation, and
educate assistants for his observatory, he had sometimes under his roof
from six to twelve pupils, whom he boarded and educated. Some of these
were named by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
King, and educated at his expense. Others were sent by different
academies and cities; and several, who had presented themselves of their
own accord, were liberally admitted by the generous astronomer.</p>

<p>As Tycho had spent nearly a ton of gold (about 100,000 dollars) in his
outlay at Uraniburg, his own income was reduced to very narrow limits.
To supply this defect, Frederick gave him an annual pension of 2000
dollars, beside an estate in Norway, and made him Canon of the Episcopal
Church of Rothschild, or Prebend of St Laurence,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
which had an annual income of 1000 dollars, and which was burdened only
with the expense of keeping up the chapel containing the Mausolea of the
Kings of the family of Oldenburg.</p>

<p>It would be an unprofitable task, and one by no means interesting to the
general reader, to give a detailed history of the various astronomical
observations and discoveries which were made by Tycho during the twenty
years that he spent at Uraniburg. Every phenomenon that appeared in the
heavens, he observed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
with the greatest care; while he at the same time carried on regular
series of observations for determining the places of the fixed stars,
and for improving the tables of the sun, moon, and planets. Though
almost wholly devoted to these noble pursuits, yet he kept an open
house, and received, with unbounded hospitality, the crowds of
philosophers, nobles, and princes who came to be introduced to the first
astronomer of the age, and to admire the splendid temple which the
Danish Sovereign had consecrated to science.</p>

<p>Among the strangers whom he received under his roof, there were some who
returned his kindness with ingratitude. Among these was Paul Witichius,
a mathematician; who, under the pretence of devoting his whole life to
astronomy, insinuated himself into the utmost familiarity with Tycho.
The unsuspecting astronomer explained to his guest all his inventions,
described all his methods, and even made him acquainted with those views
which he had not realised, and with instruments which he had not yet
executed. When Witichius had thus obtained possession of the methods,
and inventions, and views of Tycho, and had enjoyed his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
hospitality for three months, he pretended that he was obliged to return
to Germany to receive an inheritance to which he had succeeded. After
quitting Uraniburg, this ungrateful mathematician neither returned to
see Tycho, nor kept up any correspondence with him; and it was not till
five years after his departure that Tycho learned, from the letters of
the Prince of Hesse to Ranzau, that Witichius had passed through Hesse,
and had described, as his own, the various inventions and methods which
had been shewn to him in Huen.</p>

<p>Being unable to reconcile his own observations with those of Copernicus,
and with the Prutenic Tables, Tycho resolved to obtain new
determinations of the latitude of Frauenburg, in Prussia, where
Copernicus made his observations, and of Konigsberg, to the meridian of
which Rheinhold had adapted his Prutenic Tables. For these purposes he
sent one of his assistants, Elias Morsianus, with a proper instrument,
under the protection of Bylovius, Ambassador of the Margrave of Anspach,
to the King of Denmark, who was returning by sea to Germany; and after
receiving the greatest attention and assistance from the noble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Canons of Ermeland, he determined, from nearly a month&rsquo;s
observations on the sun and stars, that the latitude of Frauenburg was
54&deg; 22&frac12;&acute;, in place of 54&deg; 19&frac12;&acute;, as given by
Copernicus. In like manner he determined that the latitude of Konigsberg
was 54&deg; 43&acute;, in place of 54&deg; 17&acute;, as adopted by
Rheinhold. When Morsianus returned to Huen in July, he brought with him,
as a present to Tycho, from John Hannovius, one of the Canons of
Ermeland, the Ptolemaic Rules, or the Parallactic Instrument which
Copernicus had used and made with his own hands. It consisted of two
equal wooden rules, five cubits long, and divided into 1414 parts. Tycho
preserved this gift as one peculiarly dear to him, and, on the day of
his receiving it, he composed a set of verses in honour of the great
astronomer to whom it belonged.</p>

<p>Among the distinguished visits which were paid to Tycho, we must
enumerate that of Ulric, Duke of Mecklenburg, in 1586. Although his
daughter, Sophia, Queen of Denmark, had already paid two visits to
Uraniburg in the same year, yet such was her love of astronomy, that she
accompanied her father and his wife Elizabeth on this occasion. Ulric
was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
not only fond of science in general, but had for many years devoted
himself to chemical pursuits, and he was therefore peculiarly gratified
in examining the splendid laboratory and extensive apparatus which Tycho
possessed. It has been said by some of the biographers of Tycho, that
the Landgrave of Hesse visited Uraniburg about this period; but this
opinion is not correct, as it was only his astronomer and optician,
Rothman, who made a journey to Huen in 1591 for the recovery of his
health. Tycho had long carried on a correspondence with this able
astronomer respecting the observations made at the observatory of
Hesse-Cassel, and, during the few months which they now spent together,
they discussed in the amplest manner all the questions which had
previously been agitated. Rothman was astonished at the wonderful
apparatus which he saw at Uraniburg, and returned to his native country
charmed with the hospitality of the Danish astronomer.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have followed Tycho through a career of almost unexampled
prosperity. When he had scarcely reached his thirtieth year he was
established, by the kindness and liberality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of his sovereign, in the most splendid observatory that had ever been
erected in Europe; and a thriving family, an ample income, and a widely
extended reputation were added to his blessings. Of the value of these
gifts he was deeply sensible, and he enjoyed them the more that he
received them with a grateful heart. Tycho was a christian as well as a
philosopher. The powers of his gifted mind have been amply displayed in
his astronomical labours; but we shall now have occasion to witness his
piety and resignation in submitting to an unexpected and an adverse
destiny.</p>

<p>The love of astronomy which had been so unequivocally exhibited by
Frederick II. and his Royal Consort, inspired their courtiers with at
least an outward respect for science; and among the ministers and
advisers of the King, Tycho reckoned many ardent friends. It was every
where felt that Denmark had elevated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
herself among the nations of Europe by her liberality to Tycho; and the
peaceful glory which he had in return conferred upon his country was not
of a kind to dissatisfy even rival nations. In the conquests of science
no widow&rsquo;s or orphan&rsquo;s tears are shed, no captives are
dragged from their homes, and no devoted victims are yoked to the
chariot wheels of the triumphant philosopher. The newly acquired domains
of knowledge belong, in right of conquest, to all nations, and Denmark
had now earned the gratitude of Europe by the magnitude as well as the
success of her contingent.</p>

<p>An event, however, now occurred which threatened with destruction the
interests of Danish science. In the beginning of April 1588, Frederick
II. died in the 54th year of his age, and the 29th of his reign. His
remains were conveyed to Rothschild, and deposited in the chapel under
Tycho&rsquo;s care, where a finely executed bust of him was afterwards
placed. His son and successor, Christian IV., was only in the 11th year
of his age, and though his temper and disposition were good, yet Tycho
had reason to be alarmed at the possibility of his discontinuing the
patronage of astronomy. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
taste for science, however, which had sprung up in the Danish Court had
extended itself no wider than the influence of the reigning sovereign.
The parasites of royalty saw themselves eclipsed in the bright renown
which Tycho had acquired, and every new visit to Uraniburg by a foreign
prince supplied fresh fuel to the rancour which had long been smothering
in their breasts. The accession of a youthful king held out to his
enemies an opportunity of destroying the influence of Tycho; and though
no adverse step was taken, yet he had the sagacity to foresee, in
&ldquo;trifles light as air,&rdquo; the approaching confirmation of his
fears. Hope, however, still cheered him amid his labours, but that hope
was founded chiefly on the learning and character of Nicolas Caasius,
the Chancellor of the Kingdom, from whom he had experienced the warmest
attentions.</p>

<p>Among the princes who visited Uraniburg, there were none who conducted
themselves with more condescension and generosity than our own
sovereign, James VI. In the year 1590, when the Scottish King repaired
to Denmark to celebrate his marriage with the Princess Anne, the
King&rsquo;s sister, he paid a visit to Tycho,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
attended by his councillors and a large suite of nobility. During the
eight days which he spent at Uraniburg, James carried on long
discussions with Tycho on various subjects, but chiefly on the motion
which Copernicus had ascribed to the earth. He examined narrowly all the
astronomical instruments, and made himself acquainted with the
principles of their construction and the method of using them. He
inspected the busts and pictures in the museum, and when he perceived
the portrait of George Buchanan, his own preceptor, he could not refrain
from the strongest expressions of delight. Upon quitting the hospitable
roof of Tycho, James not only presented him with a magnificent donation,
but afterwards gave him his royal license to publish his works in
England during seventy years. This license was accompanied with the
following high eulogium on his abilities and learning:&mdash;&ldquo;Nor
have I become acquainted with these things only from the relation of
others, or from a bare inspection of your works, but I have seen then
before my own eyes, and have heard them with my own ears, in your
residence at Uraniburg, and have drawn them from the various learned and
agreeable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
conversations which I there held with you, and which even now affect my
mind to such a degree, that it is difficult to determine whether I
recollect them with greater pleasure or admiration; as I now willingly
testify, by this license, to present and to future generations,&rdquo;
&amp;c.</p>

<p>At the request of Tycho, the King also composed and wrote in his own
hand some Latin verses, which were more complimentary than classical.
His Chancellor had also composed some verses of a similar character
during his visit to Tycho. A short specimen of these will be deemed
sufficient by the classical reader:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Vidit et obstupuit Rex Huennum Scoticus almam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Miratus clari tot monumenta viri.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the year 1591, when Christian IV. had reached his 14th year, he
expressed a desire to pay a visit to Uraniburg. He accordingly set out
with a large party, consisting of his three principal senators, and
other councillors and noblemen; and having examined the various
instruments in the observatories and laboratory, he proposed to Tycho
various questions on mechanics and mathematics, but particularly on the
principles of fortification and ship building.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Having observed that he particularly admired a brass globe, which, by
means of internal wheelwork, imitated the diurnal motion of the heavens,
the rising and setting of the sun, and the phases of the moon, Tycho
made him a present of it, and received in return an elegant gold chain,
with his Majesty&rsquo;s picture, with an assurance of his unalterable
attachment and protection.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this assurance, Tycho had already, as we have stated,
begun to suspect the designs of his enemies; and in a letter addressed
to the Landgrave of Hesse, early in 1591, he throws out some hints which
indicated the anxieties that agitated his mind. The Landgrave of Hesse,
as if he had heard some rumours unfavourable to the prospects of Tycho,
requested him to write him respecting the state of the Kingdom, and
concerning his own private affairs. To this letter, which was dated
early in February, Tycho replied about the beginning of April. He
informed the Landgrave that he led a private life in his own island,
exempt from all official functions, and never willingly taking a part in
public affairs. He was desirous of leaving the ambition of public
honours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to others, and of devoting himself wholly to the study of philosophy and
astronomy; and he expressed a hope that if he should be involved in the
tumults and troubles of life, either by his own destiny or by evil
counsels, he might be able, by the blessing of God, to extricate himself
by the force of his mind and the integrity of his life. He comforted
himself with the idea that every soil was the country of a great man,
and that wherever he went the blue sky would still be over his head;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
and he distinctly states at the close of his letter, that he had thought
of transferring his residence to some other place, as there were some of
the King&rsquo;s councillors who had already begun to calumniate his
studies, and to grudge him his pension from the treasury.</p>

<p>The causes which led to this change of feeling on the part of Christian
IV.&rsquo;s advisers have not been explained by the biographers of
Tycho. It has been stated, in general terms, that he had made many
enemies, by the keenness of his temper and the severity of his satire;
but I have not been able to discover any distinct examples of these
peculiarities of his mind. In an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
event, indeed, which occurred about this time, he slightly resented a
piece of marked incivility on the part of Henry Julius, Duke of
Brunswick, who had married the Princess Eliza of Denmark; but it is not
likely that so trivial an affair, if it were known at court, could have
called down upon him the hostility of the King&rsquo;s advisers.</p>

<p>The Duke of Brunswick had, in 1590, paid a visit to Uraniburg, and had
particularly admired an antique brass statue of Mercury, about a cubit
long, which Tycho had placed in the roof of the hypocaust or central
crypt of the Stiern-berg observatory. By means of a concealed mechanism,
it moved round in a circular orbit. The Duke requested the statue and
its machinery, which Tycho gave him, on the condition that he should
obtain a model of it, for the purpose of having another executed by a
skilful workman. The Duke not only forgot his promise, but paid no
attention to the letters which were addressed to him. Tycho was justly
irritated at this unprincely conduct, and ordered this anecdote to be
inserted in the description of Uraniburg which he was now preparing for
publication.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
In the year 1592, Tycho lost his distinguished friend and correspondent
the Prince of Hesse, and astronomy one of its most active and
intelligent cultivators. His grief on this occasion was deep and
sincere, and he gave utterance to his feelings in an impassioned elegy,
in which he recorded the virtues and talents of his friend. Prince
Maurice, the son and successor of the Landgrave, continued, with the
assistance of able observers, to keep up the reputation of the
observatory of Hesse-Cassel; and the observations which were there made
were afterwards published by Snellius. The extensive and valuable
correspondence between Tycho and the Landgrave was prepared for
publication about the beginning of 1593, and contains also the letters
of Rothman and Rantzau.</p>

<p>For several years the studies of Tycho had been treated with an
unwilling toleration by the Danish Court. Many of the nobles envied the
munificent establishment which he had received from Frederick, and the
liberal pension which he drew from his treasury. But among his most
active enemies were some physicians, who envied his reputation as a
successful and a gratuitous practitioner of the healing art. Numbers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of invalids flocked to Huen, and diseases, which resisted all other
methods of cure, are said to have yielded to the panaceal prescription
of the astrologer. Under the influence of such motives, these
individuals succeeded in exciting against Tycho the hostility of the
court. They drew the public attention to the exhausted state of the
treasury. They maintained that he had possessed too long the estate in
Norway, which might be given to men who laboured more usefully for the
commonwealth; and they accused him of allowing the chapel at Rothschild
to fall into decay. The President of the Council, Christopher
Walchendorp, and the King&rsquo;s Chancellor, were the most active of
the enemies of Tycho; and, having poisoned the mind of their sovereign
against the most meritorious of his subjects, Tycho was deprived of his
canonry, his estate in Norway, and his pension.</p>

<p>Being no longer able to bear the expenses of his establishment in Huen,
and dreading that the feelings which had been excited against him might
be still further roused, so as to deprive him of the Island of Huen
itself, he resolved to transfer his instruments to some other
situation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Notwithstanding this resolution, he remained with his family in the
island, and continued his observations till the spring of 1597, when he
took a house in Copenhagen, and removed to it all his smaller and more
portable instruments, leaving those which were large or fixed in the
crypts of Stiern-berg. His first plan was to remove every thing from
Huen as a measure of security; but the public feeling began to turn in
his favour, and there were many good men in Copenhagen who did not
scruple to reprobate the conduct of the government. The President of the
Council, Walchendorp&mdash;a name which, while the heavens revolve, will
be pronounced with horror by astronomers&mdash;saw the change of
sentiment which his injustice had produced, and adopted an artful method
of sheltering himself from public odium. In consequence of a quarrel
with Tycho, the recollection of which had rankled in his breast, he
dreaded to be the prime mover in his persecution. He therefore appointed
a committee of two persons, one of whom was Thomas Feuchius, to report
to the government on the nature and utility of the studies of Tycho.
These two individuals were entirely ignorant of astronomy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and the use of instruments; and even if they had not, they would have
been equally subservient to the views of the minister. They reported
that the studies of Tycho were of no value, and that they were not only
useless, but noxious. Armed with this report, Walchendorp prohibited
Tycho, in the King&rsquo;s name, from continuing his chemical
experiments; and instigated, no doubt, by this wicked minister, an
attack was made upon himself, and his shepherd or his steward was
injured in the affray. Tycho was provoked to revenge himself upon his
enemies, and the judge was commanded not to interfere in the matter.</p>

<p>Thus persecuted by his enemies, Tycho resolved to remain no longer in an
ungrateful country. He carried from Huen every thing that was moveable,
and having packed up his instruments, his crucibles, and his books, he
hired a ship to convey them to some foreign land. His wife, his five
sons and four daughters, his male and his female servants, and many of
his pupils and assistants, among whom were Tengnagel, his future
son-in-law, and the celebrated Longomontanus, embarked at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Copenhagen, to seek the hospitality of some better country than their
own.</p>

<p>Freighted with the glory of Denmark, this interesting bark made the best
of its way across the Baltic, and arrived safely at Rostoch. Here the
exiled patriarch found many of his early friends, particularly Henry
Bruce, an able astronomer, to whom he had formerly presented one of his
brass quadrants. The approach of the plague, however, prevented Tycho
from making any arrangements for a permanent residence; and, having
received a warm invitation from Count Henry Rantzau, who lived in
Holstein at the Castle of Wandesberg, near Hamburg, he went with all his
family, about the end of 1597, to enjoy the hospitality of his friend.</p>

<p>Though Tycho derived the highest pleasure from the kindness and
conversation of Count Rantzau, yet a cloud overshadowed the future, and
he had yet to seek for a patron and a home. His hopes were fixed on the
Emperor Rudolph, who was not only fond of science, but who was
especially addicted to alchemy and astrology, and his friend Rantzau
promised to have him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
introduced to the Emperor by proper letters. When Tycho learned that
Rudolph was particularly fond of mechanical instruments and of
chemistry, he resolved to complete and to dedicate to him his work on
the mechanics of astronomy, and to add to it an account of his chemical
labours. This task he soon performed, and his work appeared in 1598
under the title of <i>Tychonis Brahe, Astronomi&aelig; instaurat&aelig;
Mechanica</i>. Along with this work he transmitted to the Emperor a copy of
his MS. catalogue of 1000 fixed stars.</p>

<p>With these proofs of his services to science, and instigated by various
letters in his favour, the Emperor Rudolph desired his Vice-Chancellor
to send for Tycho, and to assure him that he would be received according
to his great merits, and that nothing should be wanting to promote his
scientific studies. Leaving his wife and daughters at Wandesberg, and
taking with him his sons and his pupils, Tycho went to Wittemberg; but
having learned that the plague had broken out at Prague, and that the
Emperor had gone to Pilsen, he deferred for a while his journey into
Bohemia.</p>

<p>Early in the spring of 1599, when the pestilence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
had ceased at Prague, and the Emperor had returned to his capital, Tycho
set out for Bohemia. On his arrival at Prague, he found a splendid house
ready for his reception, and a kind message from the Emperor,
prohibiting him from paying his respects to him till he had recovered
from the fatigues of his journey. On his presentation to Rudolph, the
generous Emperor received him with the most distinguished kindness. He
announced to him that he was to receive an annual pension of 3000
crowns; that an estate would as soon as possible be settled upon him and
his family and their successors; that a town house would be provided for
him; and that he might have his choice of various castles and houses in
the country as the site of his observatory and laboratory. The Emperor
had also taken care to provide every thing that was necessary for
Tycho&rsquo;s immediate wants; and so overwhelmed was he with such
unexpected kindness, that he remarked that, as he could not find words
to express his gratitude, the whole heavens would speak for him, and
posterity should know what a refuge his great and good Sovereign had
been to the Queen of the Arts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Among the numerous friends whom Tycho found at Prague, were his
correspondents Coroducius and Hagecius, and his benefactor Barrovitius,
the Emperor&rsquo;s secretary. He was congratulated by them all on his
distinguished reception at court, and was regarded as the &AElig;neas of
science, who had been driven from his peaceful home, and who had carried
with him to the Latium of Germany his wife, his children, and his
household gods. If external circumstances could remove the sorrows of
the past, Tycho must now have been supremely happy. In his spacious
mansion, which had belonged to his friend Curtius, he found a position
for one of his best instruments, and having covered with poetical
inscriptions the four sides of the pedestal on which it stood, in honour
of his benefactors, as well as of former astronomers, he resumed with
diligence his examination of the stars.</p>

<p>When Rudolph saw the magnificent instruments which Tycho had brought
along with him, and had acquired some knowledge of their use, he pressed
him to send to Denmark for the still larger ones which he had left at
Stiern-berg. In the meantime, he gave him the choice of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
castles of Brandisium, Lyssa, and Benach as his country residence; and
after visiting them about the end of May, Tycho gave the preference to
Benach, which was situated upon a rising ground, and commanded an
extensive horizon. It contained splendid and commodious buildings, and
was almost, as he calls it, a small city, situated on the stream Lisor,
near its confluence with the Albis. It stood a little to the east and
north of Prague, and was distant from that city only five German miles,
or about six hours&rsquo; journey.</p>

<p>On the 20th of August, the Prefect of Brandisium gave Tycho possession
of his new residence. His gratitude to his royal patron was copiously
displayed, not only in a Latin poem written on the occasion, but in
Latin inscriptions which he placed above the doors of his observatory
and his laboratory. In order that he might establish an astronomical
school at Prague, he wrote to Longomontanus, Kepler, Muller, David
Fabricius, and two students at Wittemberg, who were good calculators,
requesting them to reside with him at Benach, as his assistants and
pupils: He at the same time dispatched his destined son-in-law,
Tengnagel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
accompanied by Pascal Muleus, to bring home his wife and daughters from
Wandesberg, and his instruments from Huen; and he begged that
Longomontanus would accompany them to Denmark, and return in the same
carriage with them to Bohemia.</p>

<p>Kepler arrived at Prague in January 1600, and, after spending three or
four months at Benach, in carrying on his inquiries and in making
astronomical observations, he returned to Gratz. Tycho had undertaken to
obtain for him the appointment of his assistant. It was arranged that
the Emperor should allow him a hundred florins, on the condition that
the states of Styria would permit him to retain his salary for two
years. This scheme, however, failed, and Kepler was about to study
medicine, and offer himself for a professorship of medicine at Tubingen,
when Tycho undertook to obtain him a permanent appointment from the
Emperor. Kepler, accordingly, returned in September 1601, and, on the
recommendation of his friend, he was named imperial mathematician, on
the condition of assisting Tycho in his observations.</p>

<p>Tycho had experienced much inconvenience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in his residence at Benach, from his ignorance of the language and
customs of the country, as well as from other causes. He was therefore
anxious to transfer his instruments to Prague; and no sooner were his
wishes conveyed to the Emperor than he gave him leave to send them to
the royal gardens and the adjacent buildings. His family and his larger
instruments having now arrived from Huen, the astronomer with his family
and his property were safely lodged in the royal edifice. Having found
that there was no house in Prague more suited for his purposes than that
of his late friend Curtius, the Emperor purchased it from his widow, and
Tycho removed into it on the 25th February 1601.</p>

<p>Although Tycho continued in this new position to observe the planets
with his usual assiduity, yet the recollection of his sufferings, and
the inconveniences and disappointments which he had experienced, began
to prey upon his mind, and to affect his health. Notwithstanding the
continued liberality of the Emperor, and the kindness of his friends and
pupils, he was yet a stranger in a distant land. Misfortune<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
was unable to subdue that love of country which was one of the most
powerful of his affections; and, though its ingratitude might have
broken the chain which bound him to the land of his nativity, it seems
only to have rivetted it more firmly. His imagination, thus influenced,
acquired an undue predominance over his judgment. He viewed the most
trifling occurrences as supernatural indications; and in those azure
moments when the clouds broke from his mind, and when he displayed his
usual wit and pleasantry, he frequently turned the conversation to the
subject of his latter end.</p>

<p>This state of mind was the forerunner, though probably the effect, of a
painful disease, which had, doubtless, its origin in the severity and
continuity of his studies. On the 13th October, when he was supping at
the house of a nobleman called Rosenberg, he was seized with a retention
of urine, which forced him to leave the party.</p>

<p>This attack continued with little intermission for more than a week,
and, during this period, he suffered great pain, attended with want of
sleep and temporary delirium, during which, he frequently exclaimed, <i>Ne
frustra vixisse videor</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
On the 24th he recovered from this painful situation, and became
perfectly tranquil. His strength, however, was gone, and he saw that he
had not many hours to live. He expressed an anxious wish that his
labours would redound to the glory of his Maker, to whom he offered up
the most ardent prayers. He enjoined his sons and his son-in-law not to
allow them to be lost. He encouraged his pupils not to abandon their
pursuits, he requested Kepler to complete the Rudolphine Tables, and to
his family he recommended piety and resignation to the Divine will.
Among those who never quitted Tycho in his illness, was Erick Brahe,
Count Wittehorn, a Swede, and a relation of his own, and Counsellor to
the King of Poland. This amiable individual never left the bedside of
his friend, and administered to him all those attentions which his
situation required. Tycho, turning to him, thanked him for his
affectionate kindness, and requested him to maintain the relationship
with his family. He then expired without pain, amid the consolations,
the prayers, and the tears of his friends. This event took place on the
24th of October 1601,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
when he was only fifty-four years and ten months old.</p>

<p>The Emperor Rudolph evinced the greatest sorrow when he was informed of
the death of his friend, and he gave orders that he should be buried in
the most honourable manner, in the principal church of the ancient
city.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
The funeral took place on the 4th November, and he was interred in the
dress of a nobleman, and with the ceremonies of his order. The funeral
oration was pronounced by Jessenius, before a distinguished assemblage,
and many elegies were written on his death.</p>

<p>Tycho was a little above the middle size, and in the last years of his
life he was slightly corpulent. He had reddish yellow hair and a ruddy
complexion. He was of a sanguine temperament, and is said to have been
sometimes irritable, and even obstinate. This failing, however, if he
did possess it, was not exhibited towards his pupils or his scientific
friends, who ever entertained for him the warmest affection and esteem.
Some of his pupils had remained in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
his house more than twenty years; and in the quarrel which arose between
him and Kepler,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
and which is allowed to have originated entirely in the temper of the
latter, he conducted himself with the greatest patience and forbearance.
There is reason to think that the irritability with which he has been
charged was less an affection of his mind than the effect of that noble
independence of character which belonged to him, and that it has been
inferred chiefly from his conduct to some of those high personages with
whom he was brought in contact. When Walchendorp, the President of the
Council, kicked his favourite hound, it was no proof of irritability of
character that Tycho expressed in strong terms his disapprobation of the
deed.</p>

<p>It was, doubtless, a greater weakness in his character that he indulged
his turn for satire, without being able to bear retaliation. His jocular
habits, too, sometimes led him into disagreeable positions. When the
Duke of Brunswick was dining with him at Uraniburg, the Duke said,
towards the end of the dinner, that, as it was late, he must be going.
Tycho jocularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
remarked that this could not be done without his permission; upon which
the Duke rose and left the party, without taking leave of his host.
Tycho became indignant in his turn, and continued to sit at table; but,
as if repenting of what he had done, he followed the Duke, who was on
his way to the ship, and, calling upon him, displayed the cup in his
hand, as if he had washed out his offence by a draught of wine.</p>

<p>Tycho was a man of true piety, and cherished the deepest veneration for
the Sacred Scriptures, and for the great truths which they reveal. Their
principles regulated his conduct, and their promises animated his hopes.
His familiarity with the wonders of the heavens increased, instead of
diminishing, his admiration of Divine wisdom, and his daily conversation
was elevated by a constant reference to a superintending Providence.</p>

<p>As a practical astronomer, Tycho has not been surpassed by any observer
of ancient or of modern times. The splendour and number of his
instruments, the ingenuity which he exhibited in inventing new ones and
in improving and adding to those which were formerly known,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and his skill and assiduity as an observer, have given a character to
his labours, and a value to his observations, which will be appreciated
to the latest posterity. The appearance of the new star in 1572 led him
to form a catalogue of 777 stars, vastly superior in accuracy to those
of Hipparchus and Ulugh Beig. His improvements on the lunar theory were
still more valuable. He discovered the important inequality called the
<i>variation</i>, and also the annual inequality which depends on the
position of the earth in its orbit. He discovered, also, the inequality
in the inclination of the moon&rsquo;s orbit, and in the motion of her
nodes. He determined with new accuracy the astronomical refractions from
an altitude of 45&deg; down to the horizon, where he found it to be
34&acute;; and he made a vast collection of observations on the planets,
which formed the groundwork of Kepler&rsquo;s discoveries and the basis
of the Rudolphine Tables. Tycho&rsquo;s powers of observation were not
equalled by his capacity for general views. It was, perhaps, owing more
to his veneration for the Scriptures than to the vanity of giving his
name to a new system that he rejected the Copernican hypothesis.
Hence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
he was led to propose a new system, called the Tychonic, in which the
earth is stationary in the centre of the universe, while the sun, with
all the other planets and comets revolving round him, performs his daily
revolution about the earth. This arrangement of the planets afforded a
sufficient explanation of the various phenomena of the heavens; and as
it was consistent with the language of Scripture, and conformable to the
indications of the senses, it found many supporters, notwithstanding the
physical absurdity of making the whole system revolve round one of the
smallest of the planets.</p>

<p>It is a painful transition to pass from the astronomical labours of
Tycho to his astrological and chemical pursuits. That Tycho studied and
practised astrology has been universally admitted. He calculated the
nativity of the Emperor Rudolph, and foretold that his relations would
make some attempts upon his life. The credulous Emperor confided in the
prediction, and when the conduct of his brother seemed to justify his
belief, he confined himself to his palace, and fell a prey to the fear
which it inspired. Tycho, however, seems to have entirely renounced his
astrological faith in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
latter days; and Kepler states,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
in the most pointed manner, that Tycho carried on his astronomical
labours with his mind entirely free from the superstitions of astrology;
that he derided and detested the vanity and knavery of astrologers, and
was convinced that the stars exercised no influence on the destinies of
men.</p>

<p>Although Tycho informed Rothman that he devoted as much labour and
expense to the study of terrestrial (chemistry) as he did to that of
celestial astronomy, yet it is a singular fact that he never published
any account of his experiments, nor has he left among his writings any
trace of his chemical inquiries. He pretended, however, to have made
discoveries in the science, and we should have been disposed to
reprobate the apology which he makes for not publishing them, did we not
know that it had been frequently given by the other alchemists of the
age&mdash;&ldquo;On consideration,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and by the advice
of the most learned men, I thought it improper to unfold the secrets of
the art (of alchemy) to the vulgar, as few persons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
were capable of using its mysteries to advantage and without
detriment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Admitting then, as we must do, that Tycho was not only a professed
alchemist, but that he was practically occupied with its pursuits, and
continually misled by its delusions, it may not be uninteresting to the
reader to consider how far a belief in alchemy, and a practice of its
arts, have a foundation in the weakness of human nature; and to what
extent they are compatible with the piety and elevated moral feeling by
which our author was distinguished.</p>

<p>In the history of human errors two classes of impostors, of very
different characters, present themselves to our notice&mdash;those who
wilfully deluded their species, and those who permitted their species to
delude themselves. The first of those classes consisted of the selfish
tyrants who upheld an unjust supremacy by systematic delusions, and of
grovelling mountebanks who quenched their avaricious thirst at the
fountains of credulity and ignorance. The second class comprehended
spirits of a nobler mould: It embraced the speculative enthusiasts, whom
the love of fame and of truth urged onward, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a fruitless research, and those great lights of knowledge and of virtue,
who, while they stood forward as the landmarks of the age which they
adorned, had neither the intellectual nor the moral courage to divest
themselves of the supernatural radiance with which the ignorance of the
vulgar had encircled them.</p>

<p>The thrones and shrines, which delusion once sustained even in the
civilized quarter of the globe, are for ever fallen, and that civil and
religious liberty, which in past ages was kept down by the marvellous
exhibitions of science to the senses, is now maintained by its
application to the reason of man. The charlatans, whether they deal in
moral or in physical wonders, form a race which is never extinct. They
migrate to the different zones of the social system, and though they
change their place, and their purposes, and their victims, yet their
character and motives remain the same. The philosophical mind,
therefore, is not disposed to study either of these varieties of
impostors; but the other two families which compose the second class are
objects of paramount interest. The eccentricities and even the
obliquities of great minds merit the scrutiny of the metaphysician
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and the moralist, and they derive a peculiar interest from the state of
society in which they are exhibited. Had Cardan and Cornelius Agrippa
lived in modern times, their vanity and self-importance would have been
checked by the forms of society, and even if their harmless pretensions
had been displayed, they would have disappeared in the blaze of their
genius and knowledge. But nursed in superstition, and educated in dark
and turbulent times, when every thing intellectual was in a state of
restless transition, the genius and character of great men necessarily
reflected the peculiarities of the age in which they lived.</p>

<p>Had history transmitted to us correct details of the leading alchemists
and scientific magicians of the dark ages, we should have been able to
analyse their actions and their opinions, and trace them, probably, to
the ordinary principles by which the human mind is in every age
influenced and directed. But when a great man has once become an object
either of interest or of wonder, and still more when he is considered as
the possessor of knowledge and skill which transcend the capacity of the
age, he is soon transformed into the hero of romance. His powers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
are overrated, his deeds exaggerated, and he becomes the subject of idle
legends, which acquire a firmer hold on credulity from the slight
sprinkling of truth with which they are seasoned. To disclaim the
possession of lofty attributes thus ascribed to great men is a degree of
humility which is not often exercised. But even when this species of
modesty is displayed, it never fails to defeat its object. It but calls
forth a deeper homage, and fixes the demigod more firmly in his shrine.</p>

<p>The history of learning furnishes us with many examples of that species
of delusion in which a great mind submits itself to vulgar adulation,
and renounces unwillingly, if it renounces at all, the unenviable
reputation of supernatural agency. In cases where self-interest and
ambition are the basis of this peculiarity of temperament, and in an age
when the conjuror and the alchemist were the companions and even the
idols of princes, it is easy to trace the steps by which a gifted sage
retains his ascendancy among the ignorant. The hecatomb which is
sacrificed to the magician, he receives as an oblation to his science,
and conscious of possessing real endowments, the idol devours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the meats that are offered to him without analysing the motives and
expectations under which he is fed. But even when the idolater and his
god are not placed in this transverse relation, the love of power or of
notoriety is sufficient to induce good men to lend a too willing ear to
vulgar testimony in favour of themselves; and in our own times it is not
common to repudiate the unmerited cheers of a popular assembly, or to
offer a contradiction to fictitious tales which record our talents or
our courage, our charity or our piety.</p>

<p>The conduct of the scientific alchemists of the thirteenth, fourteenth,
and fifteenth centuries presents a problem of very difficult solution.
When we consider that a gas, a fluid, and a solid may consist of the
very same ingredients in different proportions; that a virulent poison
may differ from the most wholesome food only in the difference of
quantity of the very same elements; that gold and silver, and lead and
mercury, and indeed all the metals, may be extracted from transparent
crystals, which scarcely differ in their appearance from a piece of
common salt or a bit of sugarcandy; and that diamond is nothing more
than charcoal,&mdash;we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
need not greatly wonder at the extravagant expectation that the precious
metals and the noblest gems might be procured from the basest materials.
These expectations, too, must have been often excited by the startling
results of their daily experiments. The most ignorant compounder of
simples could not fail to witness the magical transformations of
chemical action; and every new product must have added to the
probability that the tempting doublets of gold and silver might be
thrown from the dice-box with which he was gambling.</p>

<p>But when the precious metals were found in lead and copper by the action
of powerful re-agents, it was natural to suppose that they had been
actually formed during the process; and men of well-regulated minds even
might have thus been led to embark in new adventures to procure a more
copious supply, without any insult being offered to sober reason, or any
injury inflicted on sound morality.</p>

<p>When an ardent and ambitious mind is once dazzled with the fascination
of some lofty pursuit, where gold is the object, or fame the impulse, it
is difficult to pause in a doubtful career, and to make a voluntary
shipwreck of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the reputation which has been staked. Hope still cheers the aspirant
from failure to failure, till the loss of fortune and the decay of
credit disturb the serenity of his mind, and hurry him on to the last
resource of baffled ingenuity and disappointed ambition. The philosopher
thus becomes an impostor; and by the pretended transmutation of the
baser metals into gold, or the discovery of the philosopher&rsquo;s
stone, he attempts to sustain his sinking reputation, and recover the
fortune he has lost. The communication of the great secret is now the
staple commodity with which he is to barter, and the grand talisman with
which he is to conjure. It can be imparted only to a chosen few&mdash;to
those among the opulent who merit it by their virtues, and can acquire
it by their diligence, and the divine vengeance is threatened against
its disclosure. A process commencing in fraud and terminating in
mysticism is conveyed to the wealthy aspirant, or instilled into the
young enthusiast, and the grand mystery passes current for a season,
till some cautious professor of the art, like Tycho, denounces its
publication as detrimental to society.</p>

<p>Among the extravagant pretensions of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
alchemists, that of forming a universal medicine was perhaps not the
most irrational. It was only when they pretended to cure every disease,
and to confer longevity, that they did violence to reason. The success
of the Arabian physicians in the use of mercurial preparations naturally
led to the belief that other medicines, still more general in their
application, and efficacious in their healing powers, might yet be
brought to light; and we have no doubt that many substantial discoveries
were the result of such overstrained expectations. Tycho was not merely
a believer in the medical dogmas of the alchemists, he was actually the
discoverer of a new <i>elixir</i>, which went by his name, and which was sold
in every apothecary&rsquo;s shop as a specific against the epidemic
diseases which were then ravaging Germany. The Emperor Rudolph having
heard of this celebrated medicine, obtained a small portion of it from
Tycho by the hands of the Governor of Brandisium; but, not satisfied
with the gift, he seems to have applied to Tycho for an account of the
method of preparing it. Tycho accordingly addressed to the Emperor a
long letter, dated September 7, 1599, containing a minute account of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
process. The base of this remarkable medicine is Venetian treacle, which
undergoes an infinity of chemical operations and admixtures before it is
ready for the patient. When properly prepared he assures the Emperor
that it is better than gold, and that it may be made still more valuable
by mixing with it a single scruple either of the tincture of corals, or
sapphire, or hyacinth, or a solution of pearls, or of potable gold, if
it can be obtained free of all corrosive matter! In order to render the
medicine <i>universal</i> for all diseases which can be cured by
perspiration, and which, he says, form a third of those which attack the
human frame, he combines it with antimony, a well known sudorific in the
present practice of physic. Tycho concludes his letter by humbly
beseeching the Emperor to keep the process secret, and reserve the
medicine for himself alone!</p>

<p>The same disposition of mind which made Tycho an astrologer and an
alchemist, inspired him with a singular love of the marvellous.</p>

<p>He had various automata with which he delighted to astonish the
peasants; and by means of invisible bells, which communicated with every
part of his establishment, and which rung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
with the gentlest touch, he had great pleasure in bringing any of his
pupils suddenly before strangers, muttering at a particular time the
words &ldquo;Come hither, Peter,&rdquo; as if he had commanded their
presence by some supernatural agency. If, on leaving home, he met with
an old woman or a hare, he returned immediately to his house: But the
most extraordinary of all his peculiarities remains to be noticed. When
he lived at Uraniburg he maintained an idiot of the name of Lep, who lay
at his feet whenever he sat down to dinner, and whom he fed with his own
hand. Persuaded that his mind, when moved, was capable of foretelling
future events, Tycho carefully marked every thing he said. Lest it
should be supposed that this was done to no purpose, Longomontanus
relates that when any person in the island was sick, Lep never, when
interrogated, failed to predict whether the patient would live or die.
It is stated also in the letters of Wormius, both to Gassendi and
Peyter, that when Tycho was absent, and his pupils became very noisy and
merry in consequence of not expecting him soon home, the idiot, who was
present, exclaimed, <i>Juncher xaa laudit</i>, &ldquo;Your master has
arrived.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
On another occasion, when Tycho had sent two of his pupils to Copenhagen
on business, and had fixed the day of their return, Lep surprised him on
that day while he was at dinner, by exclaiming, &ldquo;Behold your
pupils are bathing in the sea.&rdquo; Tycho, suspecting that they were
shipwrecked, sent some person to the observatory to look for their boat.
The messenger brought back word that he saw some persons wet on the
shore, and in distress, with a boat upset at a great distance. These
stories have been given by Gassendi, and may be viewed as specimens of
the superstition of the age.</p>

<p>Tycho left behind him a wife and six children, but even in the time of
Gassendi nothing was known of their history, excepting that Tengnagel,
who married one of the daughters, gave up his scientific pursuits, and,
having been admitted among the Emperor&rsquo;s counsellors, was employed
in several of his embassies.</p>

<p>The instruments of Tycho were purchased from his heirs, by the Emperor,
for 22,000 crowns. They were shut up in the house of Curtius, and were
treated with such veneration, that no astronomer, not even Kepler
himself, was permitted to see or to use them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Here they remained till the death of the Emperor Matthias, in 1619, when
the troubles in Bohemia took place. When Prague was taken by the forces
of the Elector Palatine, the instruments were carried off, and some were
destroyed, and others converted to different purposes. The great brass
globe, however, was saved. It was first carried to Niessa, the episcopal
city of Silesia; and having been presented to the College of Jesuits, it
was preserved in their museum, till Udalric, the son of Christian, King
of Denmark, took Niessa in 1632. The globe was recognized as having
belonged to Tycho, and it was carried in triumph to Denmark. An
inscription was written upon it by Longomontanus, and it was deposited
with some pomp in the Library of the Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>After Tycho left Huen, the island was transferred to some of the Danish
nobility, and the following brief but melancholy description of it was
given by Wormius. &ldquo;There is, in the island, a field where
Uraniburg was.&rdquo; The scientific antiquities of Huen, have been more
recently described by Mr Cox, in his travels through Denmark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We landed,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;on the south west
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
part in a small bay, just below the place where a stream, supplied by
numerous pools and fish ponds, falls into the sea. We ascended the
shore, which is clothed with short herbage, crossed the stream, and
passed over a gently waving surface, gradually sloping towards the sea,
and walked a mile to a farm house, standing in the middle of the island,
inhabited by Mr Schaw, a Swedish gentleman, to whom the greater part of
the island belongs. He lives here in summer, but in winter resides at
Landscrona. This dwelling is the same as existed in Tycho Brahe&rsquo;s
time, and was the farm house belonging to his estate. A guide, whom we
obtained from Mr Schaw, conducted us to the remains of Tycho&rsquo;s
mansion, which are near the house, and consist of little more than a
mound of earth which enclosed the garden, and two pits, the sites of his
mansion and observatory.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

Tycho as Imperial Mathematician&mdash;His Work on the New Star of
1604&mdash;Singular specimen of it.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable circumstance in the history of science, that
astronomy should have been cultivated at the same time by three such
distinguished men as Tycho, Kepler, and Galileo. While Tycho, in the
54th year of his age, was observing the heavens at Prague, Kepler, only
30 years old, was applying his wild genius to the determination of the
orbit of Mars, and Galileo, at the age of 36, was about to direct the
telescope to the unexplored regions of space. The diversity of gifts
which Providence assigned to these three philosophers was no less
remarkable. Tycho was destined to lay the foundation of modern
astronomy, by a vast series of accurate observations made with the
largest and the finest instruments; it was the proud lot of Kepler to
deduce the laws of the planetary orbits from the observations of his
predecessors; while Galileo enjoyed the more dazzling honour of
discovering by the telescope new celestial bodies, and new systems of
worlds.</p>

<p>John Kepler, the youngest of this illustrious band, was born at the
imperial city of Weil, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the duchy of Wirtemberg, on the 21st December 1571. His parents, Henry
Kepler and Catherine Guldenmann, were both of noble family, but had been
reduced to indigence by their own bad conduct. Henry Kepler had been
long in the service of the Duke of Wirtemberg as a petty officer, and in
that capacity had wasted his fortune. Upon setting out for the army, he
left his wife in a state of pregnancy; and, at the end of seven months,
she gave premature birth to John Kepler, who was, from this cause, a
sickly child during the first years of his life. Being obliged to join
the army in the Netherlands, his wife followed him into the field, and
left her son, then five years old, under the charge of his grandfather
at Limberg. Sometime afterwards he was attacked with the smallpox, and
having with difficulty recovered from this severe malady, he was sent to
school in 1577.</p>

<p>Having become security for one of his friends, who absconded from his
creditors, Henry Kepler was obliged to sell his house and all his
property, and was driven to the necessity of keeping a tavern at
Elmendingen. Owing to these misfortunes, young Kepler was taken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
from school about two years afterwards, and was obliged to perform the
functions of a servant in his father&rsquo;s house. In 1585, he was
again placed in the school of Elmendingen; but his father and mother
having been both attacked with the smallpox, and he himself having been
seized with a violent illness in 1585, his education had been much
neglected, and he was prohibited from all mental application.</p>

<p>In the year 1586, on the 26th of November, Kepler was admitted into the
school at the Monastery of Maulbronn, which had been established at the
Reformation, and which was maintained at the expense of the Duke of
Wirtemberg, as a preparatory seminary for the University of Tubingen.
After remaining a year at the upper classes, the scholars presented
themselves for examination at the College for the degree of Bachelor;
and having received this, they returned to the school with the title of
Veterans. Here they completed the usual course of study; and being
admitted as resident students at Tubingen, they took their degree of
Master. In prosecuting this course of study, Kepler was sadly
interrupted, not only by periodical returns of his former complaints,
but by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
family quarrels of the most serious import. These dissensions, arising
greatly from the perverseness of his mother, drove his father to a
foreign land, where he soon died; and his mother having quarrelled with
all her relations, the affairs of the family were involved in
inextricable disorder. Notwithstanding these calamities, Kepler took his
degree of Bachelor on the 15th September 1588, and his degree of Master
in August 1591, on which occasion he held the second place at the annual
examination.</p>

<p>In his early studies, Kepler devoted himself with intense pleasure to
philosophy in general, but he entertained no peculiar affection for
astronomy. Being well grounded in arithmetic and geometry, he had no
difficulty in making himself master of the geometrical and astronomical
theorems which occurred in the course of his studies. While attending
the lectures of M&oelig;stlin, professor of mathematics, who had
distinguished himself by an oration in favour of the Copernican system,
Kepler not only became a convert to the opinions of his master, but
defended them in the physical disputations of the students, and even
wrote an essay on the primary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
motion, in order to prove that it was produced by the daily rotation of
the earth.</p>

<p>In 1594, the astronomical chair at Gratz, in Styria, fell vacant by the
death of George Stadt, and, according to Kepler&rsquo;s own statement,
he was forced to accept this situation by the authority of his
professional tutors, who recommended him to the nobles of Styria. Though
Kepler had little knowledge of the science, and no passion for it
whatever, yet the nature of his office forced him to attend to
astronomy; and, in the year 1595, when he enjoyed some leisure from his
lectures, he directed the whole energy of his mind to the three
important topics of the number, the size, and the motion of the orbits
of the planets. He first tried if the size of the planets&rsquo; orbits,
or the difference of their sizes, had any regular proportion to each
other. Finding no proof of this, he inserted a new planet between Mars
and Jupiter, and another between Venus and Mercury, which he supposed
might be invisible from their smallness; but even with these assumptions
the distances of the planets exhibited no regular progression. Kepler
next tried if these distances varied as the cosines of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the quadrant, and if their motion varied as the sun&rsquo;s, the sine of
90 representing the motion at the sun, and the sine of 0&deg; that at
the fixed stars; but in this trial he was also disappointed.</p>

<p>Having spent the whole summer in these fruitless speculations, and
praying constantly to his Maker for success, he was accidentally drawing
a diagram in his lecture-room, in July 1595, when he observed the
relation between the circle inscribed in a triangle, and that described
round it; and the ratio of these circles, which was that of 1 to 2,
appeared to his eye to be identical with that of Jupiter&rsquo;s and
Saturn&rsquo;s orbits. Hence he was led to compare the orbits of the
other planets&rsquo; circles described in pentagons and hexagons. As
this hypothesis was as inapplicable to the heavens as its predecessors,
Kepler asked himself in despair, &ldquo;What have <i>plane</i> figures to do
with <i>solid</i> orbits? Solid bodies ought to be used for solid
orbits.&rdquo; On the strength of this conceit, he supposed that the
distances of the planets were regulated by the sizes of the five regular
solids described within one another. &ldquo;The Earth is the circle, the
measurer of all. Round it describe a dodecahedron; the circle including
this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
will be Mars. Round Mars describe a tetrahedron; the circle including
this will be Jupiter. Describe a cube round Jupiter; the circle
including this will be Saturn. Then inscribe in the Earth an
icosahedron; the circle described in it will be Venus. Inscribe an
octohedron in Venus; the circle inscribed in it will be Mercury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This discovery, as he considered it, harmonized in a very rude way with
the measures of the planetary orbits given by Copernicus; but Kepler was
so enamoured with it, that he ascribed the differences to errors of
observation, and declared that he would not renounce the glory of having
made it for the whole Electorate of Saxony.</p>

<p>In his attempt to discover the relation between the periodic times of
the planets and their distances from the sun, he was not more
successful; but as this relation had a real existence, he made some
slight approach to its determination. These extraordinary researches,
which indicate the wildness and irregularity of Kepler&rsquo;s genius,
were published in 1596, in a work entitled, &ldquo;Prodromus of
Cosmographical Dissertations; containing the cosmographical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
mystery respecting the admirable proportion of the celestial orbits, and
the genuine and real causes of the number, magnitude, and periods of the
planets demonstrated by the five regular geometrical solids.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the speculative character of this volume, it obtained
for its author a high name among astronomers. Galileo and Tycho, whose
opinions of it he requested, spoke of it with some commendation. The
former praised the ingenuity and good faith which it displayed; and
Tycho, though he requested him to try to adapt something of the same
nature to the Tychonic system, saw the speculative character of his
mind, and advised him &ldquo;to lay a solid foundation for his views by
actual observation, and then, by ascending from these, to strive to
reach the causes of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1592, before Kepler had quitted Tubingen, he was on the eve of
entering into the married state. Though the foolish scheme was
fortunately broken off, yet he resumed it again in 1596, when he paid
his addresses to Barbara Millar of Muleckh, who was a widow for the
second time, though only twenty-three years of age. Her parents,
however, would not consent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to the match till Kepler proved his nobility; and, owing to the delay
which arose from this circumstance, the marriage did not take place till
1597. The income which Kepler derived from his professorship was very
small, and as his wife&rsquo;s fortune turned out much less than he had
been led to expect, he not only was annoyed with pecuniary difficulties,
but was involved in disputes with his wife&rsquo;s relations. These
evils were greatly increased by the religious troubles which took place
in Styria. The Catholics at Gratz rose against the Protestants, and
threatened to expell them from the city. Kepler, who openly professed
the Protestant religion, saw the risks to which he was exposed, and
retired with his wife into Hungary. Here he continued nearly a year,
during which he composed and transmitted to his friend Zehentmaier, at
Tubingen, several small treatises, &ldquo;On the Magnet,&rdquo;
&ldquo;On the cause of the Obliquity of the Ecliptic,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;On the Divine Wisdom, as shewn in the Creation&rdquo;&mdash;all
of which seem to have been lost. In 1599, Kepler was recalled to Gratz
by the States of Styria, and resumed his professorship; but the city was
still divided into two factions, and Kepler,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
who was a lover of peace, found his situation very uncomfortable. Having
learned from Tycho that he had been able to determine more accurately
than had been done the eccentricities of the orbits of the planets,
Kepler was anxious to avail himself of these observations, and set out
on a visit to Tycho at Prague, where he arrived in January 1600. Tycho
received him with great kindness, notwithstanding the part which he had
taken against him along with Raimar, and he spent three or four months
with him at Benach. It was then arranged that Kepler should be appointed
Tycho&rsquo;s assistant in the observatory, with a salary of 100
florins, provided the States of Styria should, on the Emperor&rsquo;s
application, allow him to be absent for two years and retain his salary.
Kepler had returned to Gratz before this arrangement was completed, and
new troubles having broke out in that city, he resigned his
professorship. Dreading lest this step would frustrate his scheme of
joining Tycho, he resolved to ask the patronage of the Duke of
Wirtemberg for the professorship of medicine at Tubingen; and with this
view he corresponded with M&oelig;stlin and his other friends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
in that University. When Tycho heard of this plan, he pressed him to
abandon it, and promised his best exertions to procure a permanent
situation for him from the Emperor.</p>

<p>Encouraged by these promises, Kepler and his wife set off for Prague,
but he was unfortunately attacked on the road with a quartan ague, which
lasted seven months; and having exhausted the little money which he had
along with him, he was obliged to apply to Tycho for a supply. After his
arrival at Prague he was supported entirely by the bounty of his friend,
and he endeavoured to make some return for this kindness by attacking in
a controversial pamphlet two of the scientific opponents of Tycho.
Kepler&rsquo;s total dependence on the generosity of his friend had made
him suspicious of his sincerity. He imagined that Tycho had not freely
communicated to him all his observations, and that he had not been
sufficiently liberal in supplying his wife with money in his absence.
While absent a second time from Prague, and influenced by these
feelings, he addressed a violent letter to Tycho, filled with
reproaches. On the plea of being occupied with his daughter&rsquo;s
marriage, Tycho requested Ericksen, one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of his assistants, to reply to Kepler&rsquo;s letter; and he did this
with so much effect, that Kepler saw his mistake, and in the noblest and
most generous manner supplicated the forgiveness of his friend. Tycho
exhibited the same good feeling; and the kindness of Hoffman, President
of the States of Styria, completed the reconciliation of the two
astronomers.</p>

<p>On his return to Prague in 1601, he was presented by Tycho to the
Emperor, who conferred upon him the title of Imperial Mathematician, on
the condition that he would assist Tycho in his calculations. This
connexion was peculiarly valuable to Kepler, as the observations of his
colleague were the only ones made in the world which could enable him to
carry on his own theoretical inquiries. These two astronomers now
undertook to compute, from Tycho&rsquo;s observations, a new set of
astronomical tables, to be called the Rudolphine Tables, in honour of
the Emperor. This scheme flattered the vanity of their master, and he
pledged himself to pay all the expenses of the work. Longomontanus,
Tycho&rsquo;s principal assistant, took upon himself the labour of
arranging and discussing the observations on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the stars, while Kepler devoted himself to the more congenial task of
examining those on the planet Mars, with which Tycho was at that time
particularly occupied. The appointment of Longomontanus to a
professorship in Denmark, and the death of Tycho in October 1601, put a
stop to these important schemes.</p>

<p>Kepler succeeded Tycho as principal mathematician to the Emperor, and
was provided with a handsome salary, which was partly charged on the
imperial treasury, and partly on the States of Silesia, and the first
instalment of which was to be paid in March 1602. The generosity of the
Emperor did not fail to excite the jealousy of ignorant individuals, who
were not aware of the value of science to the state; but the increasing
fame of Kepler, and the valuable works which he published, soon silenced
their opposition.</p>

<p>In September 1604, astronomers were surprised with the appearance of a
new star in the foot of Serpentarius. It was not seen before the 29th of
September, and M&oelig;stlin informs us that, on account of clouds, he
did not obtain a good view of it till the 6th of October. Like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
that of 1572,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
it at first surpassed Jupiter in brightness, and rivalled even Venus,
but it afterwards became as small as Regulus, and as dull as Saturn, and
disappeared at the end of a few months. It constantly changed its
colour, and was at first tawny, then yellow, then purple and red, and
often white at great altitudes. It had no parallax, and therefore was a
fixed star. Kepler wrote a short account of this remarkable body, and
maintained its superiority to that of 1572, as this last came in an
ordinary year, while the other appeared in the year of the <i>fiery
trigon</i>, or that in which Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, are in the three
fiery signs, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, an event which occurs only
every 800 years. After discussing a great variety of topics, but little
connected with his subject, and in a style of absurd jocularity, he
attacks the opinions of the Epicureans, that the star was a fortuitous
concourse of atoms, in the following remarkable paragraph, which is a
good specimen of the work:&mdash;&ldquo;When I was a youth with plenty
of idle time on my hands, I was much taken with the vanity, of which
some grown men are not ashamed, of making anagrams<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
by transposing the letters of my name, written in Latin. Out of <i>Joannes
Keplerus</i> came <i>Serpens in Akuleo</i> (a serpent in his sting); but not
being satisfied with the meaning of these words, and being unable to
make another, I trusted the thing to chance, and taking out of a pack of
playing cards as many as there were letters in the name, I wrote one
upon each, and then began to shuffle them, and at each shuffle to read
them in the order they came, to see if any meaning came of it. Now, may
all the Epicurean gods and goddesses confound this same chance, which,
although I have spent a good deal of time over it, never shewed me
anything like sense even from a distance. So I gave up my cards to the
Epicurean eternity, to be carried away into infinity; and, it is said,
they are still flying about there in the utmost confusion among the
atoms, and have never yet come to any meaning. I will tell those
disputants, my opponents, not my own opinion, but my wife&rsquo;s.
Yesterday, when weary with writing, and my mind quite dusty with
considering these atoms, I was called to supper, and a salad I had asked
for was set before me. &lsquo;It seems then,&rsquo; said I, aloud,
&lsquo;that if pewter dishes, leaves of lettuce,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
grains of salt, drops of water, vinegar, and oil, and slices of egg, had
been flying about in the air from all eternity, it might at last happen
by chance that there would come a salad.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says
my wife, &lsquo;but not so nice and well dressed as this of mine
is.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although Kepler now filled one of the most honourable situations to
which a philosopher could aspire, and possessed a large salary fitted to
supply his most reasonable wants, yet, as the imperial treasury was
drained by the demands of an expensive war, his salary was always
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
in arrear. Owing to this cause he was constantly involved in pecuniary
difficulties, and, as he himself described his situation, he was
perpetually begging his bread from the Emperor at Prague. His increasing
family rendered the want of money still more distressing, and he was
driven to the painful alternative of drawing his income from casting
nativities. From the same cause he was obliged to abandon his plan of
publishing the Rudolphine Tables, and to devote himself to works of a
less expensive kind, and which were more likely to yield some pecuniary
advantages.</p>

<p>In spite of these embarrassments, and the occupation of his time in the
practice of astrology, Kepler found leisure for his favourite pursuits.
No adverse circumstances were capable of extinguishing his scientific
ardour, and whenever he directed his vigorous mind to the investigation
of phenomena, he never failed to obtain interesting and original
results. Since the death of Tycho, his attention had been much occupied
with the subject of refraction and vision; and, in 1606, he published
the result of his researches in a work, entitled &ldquo;A Supplement to
Vitellio, in which the optical part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of astronomy is treated, but chiefly on the artificial observation and
estimation of diameters, and of the eclipses of the Sun and Moon.&rdquo;
Astronomers had long been perplexed with the refraction of the
atmosphere, and so little was known of the general subject, as well as
of this branch of it, that Tycho believed the refraction of the
atmosphere to cease at 45&deg; of altitude. Even at the beginning of the
second century, Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria had unravelled its
principal mysteries, and had given in his Optics a theory of
astronomical refraction more complete than that of any astronomer before
the time of Cassini;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
but the MSS. had unfortunately been mislaid, and Alhazen and Vitellio
and Kepler were obliged to take up the subject from its commencement.
Ptolemy had not only determined that the refraction of the atmosphere
had gradually increased from the zenith to the horizon, but he had
measured with singular accuracy the angles of refraction for water and
glass, from a perpendicular incidence to a horizontal one.</p>

<p>Kepler treated this branch of science in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
own peculiar way, &ldquo;hunting down,&rdquo; as he expressed it, every
hypothesis which his fertile imagination had successively presented to
him. In his various attempts to discover the law of refraction, or a
measure of it, as varying with the density of the body and the angle of
incidence of the light, he was nearer the goal, in his first
speculation, than in any of the rest; and he seems to have failed in
consequence of his not separating the question as it related to density
from the question as it related to incidence. &ldquo;I did not leave
untried,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;whether, by assuming a horizontal
refraction according to the density of the medium, the rest would
correspond to the sines of the distances from a vertical direction, but
calculation proved that it was not so: and, indeed, there was no
occasion to have tried it, for thus the <i>refraction would increase
according to the same law in all mediums, which is contradicted by
experiment</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although completely foiled in his search after the law of refraction,
which was subsequently discovered by Willebrord Snell, and sometime
afterwards by James Gregory, he was, singularly successful in his
inquiries respecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
vision. Regarding the eye as analogous in its structure with the camera
obscura of Baptista Porta, he discovered that the images of external
objects were painted in an inverted position on the retina, by the union
of the pencils of rays which issued from every point of the object. He
ascribed an erect vision to an operation of the mind, by which it traces
the rays back to the pupil, where they cross one another, and thus
refers the lower parts of the image to the higher parts of the object.
He also explained the cause of long-sighted and short-sighted vision,
and shewed how convex and concave lenses enabled those who possessed
these peculiarities of vision to see distinctly, by accurately
converging the pencils of rays to a focus on the retina. Kepler likewise
observed the power of accommodating the eye to different distances, and
he ascribed it to the contraction of the ciliary processes, which drew
the sides of the eyeball towards the crystalline lens, and thus
elongated the eye so as to produce an adjustment of it for near objects.
Kepler wisely declined to inquire into the way in which the mind
perceives the images painted on the retina,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and he blames Vitellio for attempting to determine a question which he
considered as not belonging to optics.</p>

<p>The work of Kepler, now under consideration, contains the method of
calculating eclipses which is now in use at the present day.</p>

<p>The only other optical treatise written by Kepler, was his <i>Dioptrics</i>,
with an appendix on the use of optics in philosophy. This admirable
work, which laid the foundation of the science, was published at
Augsburg in 1611, and reprinted at London in 1653. Although Maurolycus
had made some slight progress in studying the passage of light through
different media, yet it is to Kepler that we owe the methods of tracing
the progress of rays through transparent bodies with convex and concave
surfaces, and of determining the foci of lenses, and of the relative
positions of the images which they form, and the objects from which the
rays proceed. He was thus led to explain the <i>rationale</i> of the
telescope, and to invent the astronomical telescope, which consists of
two convex lenses, by which objects are seen inverted. Kepler also
discovered the important fact, that spherical surfaces were not capable
of converging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
rays to a single focus, and he conjectured, what Descartes afterwards
proved, that this property might be possessed by lenses having the
figure of some of the sections of the cone. The total reflection of
light at the second surface of bodies was likewise studied by Kepler,
and he determined that the total reflection commenced when the angle of
incidence was equal to the angle of refraction, which corresponded to an
incidence of 90.</p>

<p>Two years before the publication of his Dioptrics, viz. in 1609, Kepler
had given to the world his great work, entitled &ldquo;The New
Astronomy, or Commentaries on the Motions of Mars.&rdquo; The
discoveries which this volume records form the basis of physical
astronomy. The inquiries by which he was led to them began in that
memorable year 1601, when he became the colleague or assistant of Tycho.
The powers of original genius were then for the first time associated
with inventive skill and patient observation; and though the
astronomical data provided by Tycho were sure of finding their
application in some future age, yet without them Kepler&rsquo;s
speculations would have been vain, and the laws which they enabled him
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
determine would have adorned the history of another century. Having
tried in vain to represent the motion of Mars by an uniform motion in a
circular orbit, and by the cycles and epicycles with which Copernicus
had endeavoured to explain the planetary inequalities, Kepler was led,
after many fruitless speculations,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
to suppose the orbit of the planet to be oval; and, from his knowledge
of the conic sections, he afterwards determined it to be an ellipse,
with the sun placed in one of its foci. He then ascertained the
dimensions of the orbit; and, by a comparison of the times employed by
the planet to complete a whole revolution or any part of one, he
discovered that the time in which Mars describes any arches of his
elliptic orbit, were always to one another as the areas contained by
lines drawn from the focus or the centre of the sun to the extremities
of the respective arches; or, in other words, that the radius vector, or
the line joining the Sun and Mars described equal areas in equal
times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
By examining the inequalities of the other planets he found that they
all moved in elliptic orbits, and that the radius vector of each
described areas proportional to the times. These two great results are
known by the name of the first and second laws of Kepler. The third law,
or that which relates to the connexion between the periodic times and
the distances of the planets, was not discovered till a later period of
his life.</p>

<p>When Kepler presented to Rudolph the volume which contained these fine
discoveries, he reminded him jocularly of his requiring the sinews of
war to make similar attacks upon the other planets. The Emperor,
however, had more formidable enemies than Jupiter and Saturn, and from
the treasury, which war had exhausted, he found it difficult to supply
the wants of science. While Kepler was thus involved in the miseries of
poverty, misfortunes of every kind filled up the cup of his adversity.
His wife, who had long been the victim of low spirits, was seized,
towards the end of 1610, with fever, epilepsy, and phrenitis, and before
she had completely recovered, all his three children were simultaneously
attacked with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
smallpox. His favourite son fell a victim to this malady, and at the
same time Prague was partially occupied by the troops of Leopold. The
part of the city where Kepler resided was harassed by the Bohemian
levies, and, to crown this list of evils, the Austrian troops introduced
the plague into the city.</p>

<p>Sometime afterwards Kepler set out for Austria with the view of
obtaining the professorship of mathematics at Linz, which was now
vacant; but, upon his return in June, he found his wife in a decline,
brought on by grief for the loss of her son, and she was sometime
afterwards seized with an infectious fever, of which she died.</p>

<p>The Emperor Rudolph was unwilling to allow Kepler to quit Prague. He
encouraged him with hopes that the arrears of his salary would be paid
from Saxony; but these hopes were fallacious, and it was not till the
death of Rudolph, in 1612, that Kepler was freed from these distressing
embarrassments.</p>

<p>On the accession of Mathias, Rudolph&rsquo;s brother, Kepler was
re-appointed imperial mathematician, and was allowed to accept the
professorship at Linz. His family now consisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of two children&mdash;a daughter, Susannah, born in 1602, and a son,
Louis, born in 1607. His own time was so completely occupied by his new
professorial duties, as well as by his private studies, that he found it
necessary to seek another parent for his children. For this purpose, he
gave a commission to his friends to look out for him a suitable wife,
and, in a long and jocular letter to Baron Strahlendorf, he has given an
amusing account of the different negotiations which preceded his
marriage. The substance of this letter is so well given by Mr Drinkwater
Bethune, that we shall follow his account of it.</p>

<p>The first of the eleven ladies among whom his inclinations wavered,
&ldquo;was a widow, an intimate friend of his first wife; and who, on
many accounts, appeared a most eligible match. At first,&rdquo; says
Kepler, &ldquo;she seemed favourably inclined to the proposal; it is
certain that she took time to consider it, but at last she very quietly
excused herself.&rdquo; It must have been from a recollection of this
lady&rsquo;s good qualities, that Kepler was induced to make his offer;
for we learn rather unexpectedly, after being informed of her decision,
that when he soon afterwards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
paid his respects to her, it was the first time that he had seen her
during the last six years; and he found, to his great relief, that
&ldquo;there was no single pleasing part about her.&rdquo; The truth
seems to be, that he was nettled by her answer, and he is at greater
pains than appears necessary, considering this last discovery, to
determine why she would not accept his offered hand. Among other
reasons, he suggested her children, among whom were two marriageable
daughters; and it is diverting afterwards to find them also in the
catalogue, which Kepler appeared to be making, of all his female
acquaintance.... Of the other ladies, one was too old, another in bad
health, another too proud of her birth and quarterings, a fourth had
learned nothing but shewy accomplishments, &ldquo;not at all suitable to
the sort of life she would have to lead with me,&rdquo; another grew
impatient, and married a more decided admirer, whilst he was hesitating.
&ldquo;The mischief,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;in all these attachments
was, that whilst I was delaying, comparing and balancing conflicting
reasons, every day saw me inflamed with a new passion.&rdquo; By the
time he reached the 8th, he found his match in this respect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
&ldquo;Fortune at length has avenged herself on my doubtful
inclinations. At first she was quite complying, and her friends also;
presently, whether she did or did not consent, not only I, but she
herself did not know. After the lapse of a few days came a renewed
promise, which, however, had to be confirmed a third time; and four days
after that, she again repeated her confirmation, and begged to be
excused from it. Upon this I gave her up, and this time all my
counsellors were of one opinion.&rdquo; This was the longest courtship
in the list, having lasted three whole months; and, quite disheartened
by its bad success, Kepler&rsquo;s next attempt was of a more timid
complexion. His advances to No. 9 were made by confiding to her the
whole story of his recent disappointment, prudently determining to be
guided in his behaviour, by observing whether the treatment he had
experienced met with a proper degree of sympathy. Apparently the
experiment did not succeed; and, almost reduced to despair, Kepler
betook himself to the advice of a friend, who had for some time past
complained that she was not consulted in this difficult negotiation.
When she produced No. 10, and the first visit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
was paid, the report upon her was as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;She has,
undoubtedly, a good fortune, is of good family, and of economical
habits: but her physiognomy is most horribly ugly; she would be stared
at in the streets, not to mention the striking disproportion in our
figures. I am lank, lean, and spare; she short and thick: in a family
notorious for fulness, she is considered superfluously fat.&rdquo; The
only objection to No. 11 seems to have been her excessive youth; and
when this treaty was broken off on that account, Kepler turned his back
upon all his advisers, and chose for himself one who had figured as No.
5 in the list, to whom he professes to have felt attached throughout,
but from whom the representations of his friends had hitherto detained
him, probably on account of her humble station.</p>

<p>The following is Kepler&rsquo;s summary of her character:&mdash;&ldquo;Her
name is Susannah, the daughter of John Reuthinger and Barbara, citizens
of the town of Eferdingen. The father was by trade a cabinetmaker, but
both her parents are dead. She has received an education well worth the
largest dowry, by favour of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the Lady of Stahrenberg, the strictness of whose household is famous
throughout the province. Her person and manners are suitable to
mine&mdash;no pride, no extravagance. She can bear to work; she has a
tolerable knowledge how to manage a family; middle-aged, and of a
disposition and capability to acquire what she still wants. Her I shall
marry, by favour of the noble Baron of Stahrenberg, at 12 o&rsquo;clock
on the 30th of next October, with all Eferdingen assembled to meet us,
and we shall eat the marriage dinner at Maurice&rsquo;s at the Golden
Lion.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Kepler&rsquo;s marriage seems to have taken place at the time here
mentioned; for, in his book on <ins class='corr' title="The original
read 'guaging'.">gauging</ins>, published at Linz in 1615, he informs us that
he took home his new wife in November, on which occasion he found it
necessary to stock his cellar with a few casks of wine. When the
wine-merchant came to measure the casks, Kepler objected to his method,
as he made no allowance for the different sizes of the bulging parts of
the cask. From this accident, Kepler was led to study the subject of
<ins class='corr' title="The original read 'guaging'.">gauging</ins>,
and to write the book which we have mentioned, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
which contains the earliest specimens of the modern analysis.</p>

<p>About this period, Kepler was summoned to the Diet at Ratisbon, to give
his opinion on the reformation of the kalendar, and he published a short
essay on the subject; but though the Government did not scruple to avail
themselves of his services, yet his pension was allowed to fall in
arrear, and, in order to support his family, he was obliged to publish
an Almanac, suited to the taste of the age. &ldquo;In order,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;to defray the expense of the Ephemeris for two years,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
I have been obliged to compose <i>a vile prophesying Almanac, which is
scarcely more respectable than begging</i>, unless from its saving the
Emperor&rsquo;s credit, who abandons me entirely, and would suffer me to
perish with hunger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although Kepler&rsquo;s residence at Linz was rendered uncomfortable by
the Roman Catholics, who had excommunicated him on account of his
refusing to subscribe to some opinions respecting the ubiquity of our
Saviour, or,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
as others maintain, on account of some opinions which he had expressed
respecting transubstantiation, yet he refused, in 1617, to accept of an
invitation to fill the mathematical chair at Bologna. The prospect of
his fortune being bettered by such a change could not reconcile him to
live in a country where his freedom of speech and manners might expose
him to suspicion; and he accordingly declined, in the most respectful
manner, the offer which was made him.</p>

<p>Kepler was kept in a state of constant anxiety from the delay in the
Government to pay up the arrears of his pension, while their repeated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
promises prevented him from accepting of other employments. He had hoped
that the affair of the Bolognese chair would rouse the imperial treasury
to a sense of its duty, and enable him to publish the Rudolphine
Tables,&mdash;that great work which he owed to the memory both of Tycho and
of Rudolph. But though he was disappointed in this expectation, an event
now occurred which at least held out the prospect of a favourable change
in his circumstances. The Emperor Mathias died in 1619, and was
succeeded by Ferdinand III., who not only continued him in the situation
of his principal mathematician, with his former pension, but promised to
pay up the arrears of it, and to furnish the means for publishing the
Rudolphine Tables.</p>

<p>The year 1619, so favourable to Kepler&rsquo;s prospects in life, was
distinguished also by the publication, at Linz, of one of his most
remarkable productions, entitled &ldquo;The Harmonies of the
World.&rdquo; It is dedicated to James I. of England, and will be for
ever memorable in the history of science, as containing the celebrated
law that the squares of the periodic times of the planets are to one
another as the cubes of their distances. This singular volume, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
is marked with all the peculiarities which distinguish his
Cosmographical Mystery, is divided into five books. The two first books
are principally geometrical, and relate to regular polygons inscribed in
a circle; the third book is a treatise on music, in which musical
proportions are derived from figures; the fourth book is astrological,
and treats of the harmony of rays emanating on the earth from the
heavenly bodies, and on their influence over the sublunary or human
soul; the fifth book is astronomical and metaphysical, and treats of the
exquisite harmonies of the celestial motions, and of the celebrated
third law of the universe, which we have already referred to.</p>

<p>This law, as he himself informs us, first entered his mind on the 8th
March 1618; but, having made an erroneous calculation, he was obliged to
reject it. He resumed the subject on the 15th May; and having discovered
his former error, he recognised with transport the absolute truth of a
principle which for seventeen years had been the object of his incessant
labours. The delight which this grand discovery gave him had no bounds.
&ldquo;Nothing holds me,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;I will indulge in my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
sacred fury; I will triumph over mankind by the honest confession, that
I have stolen the golden vases of the Egyptians, to build up a
tabernacle for my God, far away from the confines of Egypt. If you
forgive me, I rejoice; if you are angry, I can bear it. The die is cast;
the book is written, to be read either now or by posterity, I care not
which. It may well wait a century for a reader, as God has waited six
thousand years for an observer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About the same time, in 1618, Kepler published, at Linz, the <i>three</i>
first books of his &ldquo;Epitome of the Copernican Astronomy,&rdquo; of
which the <i>fourth</i> was published at the same place in 1622, and the
<i>fifth</i>, <i>sixth</i>, and <i>seventh</i> at Frankfort in the same year. This
interesting work is a kind of summary of all his astronomical views,
drawn up in the form of a dialogue for the perusal of general readers.
Immediately after its publication, it was placed by the Inquisition in
the list of prohibited books; and the moment Kepler learned this from
his correspondent Remus, he was thrown into great alarm, and requested
from him some information respecting the terms and consequences of the
censure which was then pronounced against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
him. He was afraid that it might compromise his personal safety if he
went to Italy; that he would be compelled to retract his opinions; that
the censure might extend to Austria; that the sale of his work would be
ruined; and that he must either abandon his country or his opinions.</p>

<p>The reply of his friend Remus calmed his agitated mind, by explaining to
him the true nature of the prohibition; and he concluded his letter with
a piece of seasonable exhortation, &ldquo;There is no ground for your
alarm either in Italy or in Austria, only keep yourself within bounds,
and put a guard upon your own passions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the year 1620, Sir Henry Wotton, the English ambassador at Venice,
paid a visit to Kepler on his way through Germany. It does not appear
whether or not this visit was paid at the desire of James I., to whom
Kepler had dedicated one of his works, but from the nature of the
communication which was made to him by the ambassador, there are strong
reasons to think that this was the case. Sir Henry Wotton urged Kepler
to take up his residence in England, where he could assure him of a
welcome and an honourable reception; but, notwithstanding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the pecuniary difficulties in which he was then involved, he did not
accept of the invitation. In referring to this offer in one of his
letters, written a year after it was made, he thus balances the
difficulties of the question&mdash;&ldquo;The fires of civil war,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;are raging in Germany. Shall I then cross the sea
whither Wotton invites me? I, a German, a lover of firm land, who dread
the confinement of an island, who presage its dangers, and must drag
along with me my little wife and flock of children?&rdquo; As Kepler
seems to have entertained no doubt of his being well provided for in
England, it is the more probable that the British Sovereign had made him
a distinct offer through his ambassador. A welcome and an honourable
reception, in the ordinary sense of these terms, could not have supplied
the wants of a starving astronomer, who was called upon to renounce a
large though an ill-paid salary in his native land; and Kepler had
experienced too deeply the faithlessness of royal pledges to trust his
fortune to so vague an assurance as that which is implied in the
language of the English ambassador. During the two centuries which have
elapsed since this invitation was given to Kepler,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
there has been no reign during which the most illustrious foreigner
could hope for pecuniary support, either from the Sovereign or the
Government of England. What English science has never been able to
command for her indigenous talent, was not likely to be proffered to
foreign merit. The generous hearts of individual Englishmen, indeed, are
always open to the claims of intellectual pre-eminence, and ever ready
to welcome the stranger whom it adorns; but through the frozen
life-blood of a British minister such sympathies have seldom vibrated;
and, amid the struggles of faction and the anxieties of personal and
family ambition, he has turned a deaf ear to the demands of genius,
whether she appeared in the humble posture of a suppliant, or in the
prouder attitude of a national benefactor.</p>

<p>If the imperial mathematician, therefore, had no other assurance of a
comfortable home in England than that of Sir Henry Wotton, he acted a
wise part in distrusting it; and we rejoice that the sacred name of
Kepler was thus withheld from the long list of distinguished characters
whom England has starved and dishonoured.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
In the year 1620, Kepler was exposed to a severe calamity, which
continued to harass him for some time. His mother, Catherine Kepler, to
whose peculiarities of temper we have already referred, was arrested on
the 5th April, upon a charge of a very serious nature. One of her
friends having some years before suffered a miscarriage, was
subsequently attacked with violent headaches, and Catherine was charged
with having administered poison to her friend. This accusation was
indignantly repelled, and a young doctor of the law, whom she consulted,
advised her to raise an action against her calumniator. From
professional reasons, or probably pecuniary ones, this zealous
practitioner continued to delay the lawsuit for five years. The judge
who tried it happened to be displaced, and was succeeded by another, who
had a personal quarrel with the prosecutor. The defender, who was aware
of this favourable change in her case, became the accuser, and, in July
1620, Catherine Kepler was sent to prison, and condemned to the torture.
The moment this event reached the ears of her son, he quitted Linz, and
arrived in time to save her from punishment. He found that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the evidence upon which she was condemned had no other foundation but
her own intemperate conduct; and, though his interference was
successful, yet she was not finally released from prison till the 4th
November 1621. Convinced of her innocence, this bold woman, now in the
79th year of her age, raised a new action for damages against her
opponent; but her death, in April 1622, put an end to her own miseries,
as well as to the anxiety of her son. Among the virtues of this singular
woman, we must number that of generosity. M&oelig;stlin, the old
preceptor of Kepler, had generously declined any compensation for his
instructions. Kepler never forgot this act of kindness, and, in the
midst of his poverty, he found means to send to M&oelig;stlin a handsome
silver cup in token of his gratitude. In acknowledging this gift,
M&oelig;stlin remarks, &ldquo;Your mother had taken it into her head
that you owed me 200 florins, and had brought 15 florins and a
chandelier towards reducing the debt, which I advised her to send to
you. I asked her to stay to dinner, which she refused. However, we
hanselled your cup, as you know she is of a thirsty temperament.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
In the same year in which his mother was arrested, the States of Styria
ordered all the copies of the Kalendar for 1624 to be publicly burnt.
There does not seem to be any reason for supposing that this insult
proceeded from his old enemies the Catholics. They would, no doubt, take
an active share in carrying it into effect; but it would appear that his
former patrons were affronted at Kepler&rsquo;s giving the precedence in
his title page to the States of Upper Ens, where he then resided, above
the States of Styria.</p>

<p>In 1622, the Emperor Ferdinand, notwithstanding his own pecuniary
difficulties, ordered the whole of Kepler&rsquo;s arrears to be paid,
even those which had been due by Rudolph and Mathias; and so great was
his anxiety to have the Rudolphine Tables published, that he supplied
the means for their immediate completion. New difficulties, however,
sprung up to retard still longer the appearance of this most important
work. The wars of the reformation, which were then agitating the whole
of Germany, interfered with every peaceful pursuit. The library of
Kepler was sealed up by order of the Jesuits, and it was only his
position as imperial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
mathematician that saved him from personal inconvenience. A popular
insurrection followed in the train of these disasters. The peasantry
blockaded Linz, the place of Kepler&rsquo;s residence, and it was not
till the year 1627, as the title page bears, or 1628, as Kepler
elsewhere states, that these celebrated Tables were given to the world.</p>

<p>The Rudolphine Tables were published at Ulm in one volume folio. These
Tables were calculated by Kepler from the Observations of Tycho, and are
founded on his own great discovery of the ellipticity of the planetary
orbits. The <i>first</i> and <i>third</i> parts of the work contain logarithmic
and other auxiliary tables, for the purpose of facilitating astronomical
calculations. The <i>second</i> part contains tables of the sun, moon, and
planets; and the <i>fourth</i> a catalogue of 1000 stars, as determined by
Tycho. A nautical map is prefixed to some copies of the tables, and the
description of it contains the first notice of the method of determining
the longitude by means of occultations.</p>

<p>A short time after the publication of these tables, the Grand Duke of
Tuscany, instigated no doubt by Galileo, sent Kepler a gold chain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
in testimony of his approbation of the great service which he had
rendered to astronomy.</p>

<p>About this time Albert Wallenstein, Duke of Friedland, a great patron of
astrology, and one of the most distinguished men of the age, made the
most munificent offers to Kepler, and invited him to take up his
residence at Sagan in Silesia. The religious dissensions which agitated
Linz, the love of tranquillity which Kepler had so little enjoyed, and
the publication of his great work, induced him to accept of this offer.
He accordingly removed his family from Linz to Ratisbon in 1629, and he
himself set out for Prague, with the double object of presenting the
Rudolphine Tables to the Emperor, and of soliciting his permission to go
into the service of the Duke of Friedland. The Emperor did not hesitate
to grant this request; and would have gladly transferred Kepler&rsquo;s
arrears as well as himself to the charge of a foreign prince. Kepler
accordingly set out with his wife and family for Sagan, where he arrived
in 1629. The Duke Albert treated him with liberality and distinction. He
supplied him with an assistant for his calculations, and also with a
printing press; and, by his influence with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the Duke of Mecklenburg, he obtained for him a professorship in the
University of Rostoch.</p>

<p>In this remote situation, Kepler found it extremely difficult to obtain
payment of the imperial pension which he still retained. The arrears had
accumulated to 8000 crowns, and he resolved to go to the Imperial
Assembly at Ratisbon to make a final effort to obtain them. His
attempts, however, were fruitless. The vexation which this occasioned,
and the great fatigue which he had undergone, threw him into a violent
fever, which is said to have been one of cold, and to have been
accompanied with an imposthume in his brain, occasioned by too much
study. This disease baffled the skill of his physicians, and carried him
off on the 5th November, O.S. 1630, in the sixtieth year of his age.</p>

<p>The remains of this great man were interred in St Peter&rsquo;s
Churchyard at Ratisbon, and the following inscription, embodying an
epitaph which he had written for himself, was engraven on his tombstone.</p>

<p>This monument was not long preserved. It was destroyed during the wars
which desolated Germany; and no attempt was made till 1786 to mark with
honour the spot which contained such venerable remains. This attempt,
however, failed, and it was not till 1803 that this great duty was paid
to the memory of Kepler, by the Prince Bishop of Constance, who erected
a handsome monumental temple near the place of his interment, and in the
Botanical Garden of the city. The temple is surmounted by a sphere, and
in the centre is a bust of Kepler in Carrara marble.</p>

<p>Kepler left behind him a wife and seven children&mdash;two by his first wife,
Susanna and Louis; and three sons and two daughters by his second wife,
viz.&mdash;Sebald, Cordelia, Friedman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Hildebert, and Anna Maria. The eldest of these, Susanna, was married a
few months before her father&rsquo;s death to Jacob Bartschius, his
pupil, who was educated as a physician; and his son Louis died in 1663,
while practising medicine at Konigsberg. The children by his second wife
are said to have died young. They were left in very narrow
circumstances; and though 24,000 florins were due to Kepler by the
Emperor, yet only a part of this sum was received by Susanna, in
consequence of her refusing to give up Tycho&rsquo;s Observations till
the debt was paid. Kepler composed a little work entitled &ldquo;The
Dream of John Kepler, or Lunar Astronomy,&rdquo; the object of which was
to describe the phenomena seen from the moon; but he died while he and
Bartschius were engaged in its publication, and Bartschius having
resumed the task, died also before its completion. Louis Kepler dreaded
to meddle with a work which had proved so fatal to his father and his
brother-in-law, but this superstitious feeling was overcome, and the
work was published at Frankfort in 1636.</p>

<p>Although the labours of Kepler were frequently interrupted by severe and
long-continued indisposition, as well as by the pecuniary embarrassments
in which he was constantly involved, yet the ardour and power of his
mind enabled him to surmount all the difficulties of his position. Not
only did he bring to a successful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
completion the leading inquiries which he had begun, but he found
leisure for composing an immense number of works more or less connected
with the subject of his studies. Between 1594, when he published his
Kalendar at Gratz, and 1630, the year of his death, he published no
fewer than <i>thirty-three</i> separate works; and he left behind him
<i>twenty-two</i> volumes of manuscripts, <i>seven</i> of which contain his
epistolary correspondence.</p>

<p>The celebrated astronomer Hevelius, who was a cotemporary of Louis
Kepler, purchased all these manuscripts from Kepler&rsquo;s
representatives. At the death of Hevelius they were bought by M.
Gottlieb Hansch, a zealous mathematician, who was desirous of giving
them to the world. For this purpose he issued a prospectus in 1714 for
publishing them by subscription, in 22 volumes folio; but this plan
having failed, he was introduced to Charles VI., who liberally obtained
for him 1000 ducats to defray the expense of the publication, and an
annual pension of 300 florins. With such encouragement, Hansch published
in 1718, in one volume folio, the correspondence of Kepler, entitled
&ldquo;<i>Epistol&aelig; ad Joannem Keplerum, insertis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
ad easdem responsionibus Keplerianis, quidquid hactenus reperiri
potuerunt, opus novum, et cum Jo. Kepleri vita.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The expenses of this volume unfortunately exhausted the 1000 ducats
which had been granted by the Emperor, and, instead of being able to
publish the rest of the MSS., Hansch was under the necessity of pledging
them for 828 florins. Under these difficulties he addressed himself in
vain to the celebrated Wolfius, to the Royal Society of London, and to
other bodies that were likely to interest themselves in such a subject.
In 1761, when M. De Murr of Nuremberg was in London, he made great
exertions to obtain the MSS., and Dr Bradley is said to have been on the
eve of purchasing them. The competition probably raised the demands of
the proprietor, in whose hands they continued for many years. In 1773
they were offered for 4000 francs, and sometime afterwards M. De Murr
purchased them for the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St Petersburg, in
whose library they still remain. Euler, Lexell, and Kraft undertook the
task of examining them, and selecting those that were best fitted for
publication, but we believe that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
no steps have yet been taken for executing this task, nor are we aware
that science would derive any advantage from its completion.</p>

<p>Although, in drawing his own character, Kepler describes himself as
&ldquo;troublesome and choleric in politics and domestic matters,&rdquo;
yet the general events of his life indicate a more peaceful disposition
than might have been expected from the peculiarities of his mind and the
ardour of his temperament. On one occasion, indeed, he wrote a violent
and reproachful letter to Tycho, who had given him no just ground of
offence; but the state of Kepler&rsquo;s health at that moment, and the
necessitous circumstances in which he had been placed, present some
palliation of his conduct. But, independent of this apology, his
subsequent conduct was so truly noble as to reconcile even Tycho to his
penitent friend. Kepler quickly saw the error which he committed; he
lamented it with genuine contrition, and was anxious to remove any
unfavourable impression which he might have given of his friend, by the
most public confession of his error, and by the warmest acknowledgments
of the kindness of Tycho.</p>

<p>In his relations with the scientific men of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
own times, Kepler conducted himself with that candour and love of truth
which should always distinguish the philosopher. He was never actuated
by any mean jealousy of his rivals. He never scrupled to acknowledge
their high merits; and when the discoveries made by the telescope
established beyond a doubt the errors of some of Kepler&rsquo;s views,
he willingly avowed his mistake, and never joined in the opposition
which was made by many of his friends to the discoveries of Galileo. A
striking example of this was exhibited in reference to his supposed
discovery of Mercury on the sun&rsquo;s disc. In the year 1607,<a
name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Kepler observed upon the face of the sun a dark spot, which he mistook
for Mercury; but the day proving cloudy, he had not the means of
determining by subsequent observations whether or not this opinion was
well founded. As spots on the sun were at that time unknown, Kepler did
not hesitate to publish the fact in 1607, in his <i>Mercurius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
in Sole visus</i>; but when Galileo, a few years afterwards, discovered a
great number of similar spots with the telescope, Kepler retracted his
opinions, and acknowledged that Galileo&rsquo;s discovery afforded an
explanation, also, of many similar observations in old writers, which he
had found it difficult to reconcile with the actual motions of Mercury.</p>

<p>Kepler was not one of those cold-hearted men who, though continually
occupied in the study of the material world, and ambitious of the
distinction which a successful examination of it confers, are yet
insensible to the goodness and greatness of the Being who made and
sustains it. His mind was cast in a better mould. The magnificence and
harmony of the divine works excited in him not only admiration but love.
He felt his own humility the farther he was allowed to penetrate into
the mysteries of the universe; and sensible of the incompetency of his
unaided powers for such transcendent researches, and recognising himself
as but the instrument which the Almighty employed to make known his
wonders, he never entered upon his inquiries without praying for
assistance from above. This frame of mind was by no means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
inconsistent with that high spirit of delight and triumph with which
Kepler surveyed his discoveries. His was the unpretending ovation of
success, not the ostentatious triumph of ambition; and if a noble pride
did occasionally mingle itself with his feelings, it was the pride of
being the chosen messenger of physical truth, not that of being the
favoured possessor of superior genius. With such a frame of mind, Kepler
was necessarily a Christian. The afflictions with which he was beset
confirmed his faith and brightened his hopes: he bore them in all their
variety and severity with Christian patience; and though he knew that
this world was to be the theatre of his intellectual glory, yet he felt
that his rest and his reward could be found only in another.</p>

<p>It is difficult to form any very intelligible idea of the nature and
extent of Kepler&rsquo;s astrological opinions, and of the degree of
credit which he himself placed in the opinions that he did avow. In his
Principles of Astrology, published in 1602, and in other works, he rails
against the vanity and worthlessness of the ordinary astrology. He
regards those who professed it as knaves and charlatans; and maintains
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
that the planets and stars exercise no influence whatever over human
affairs. He conceives, however, that certain harmonious configurations
of suitable planets, like the spur to a horse, or a speech to an
audience, have the power of exciting the minds of men to certain general
actions or impulses; so that the only effect of these configurations is
to operate along with the vital soul in producing results which would
not otherwise have taken place. As an example of this, he states that
those who are born when many aspects of the planets occur, <i>generally</i>
turn out busy and industrious, whether they be occupied in amassing
wealth, managing public affairs, or prosecuting scientific studies.
Kepler himself was born under a triple configuration, and hence, in his
opinion, his ardour and activity in study; and he informs us that he
knew a lady born under nearly the same configurations, &ldquo;who not
only makes no progress in literature, but troubles her whole family and
occasions deplorable misery to herself.&rdquo; This excitement of the
faculties of sublunary natures, as he expresses it, by the colours and
aspects and conjunctions of the planets, is regarded by Kepler as a
fact, which he had deduced from observation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and which has &ldquo;compelled his unwilling belief.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
have been driven to this,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;not by studying or
admiring Plato, but singly and solely by observing seasons, and noting
the aspects by which they are produced. I have seen the state of the
atmosphere almost uniformly disturbed as often as the planets are in
conjunction, or in the other configurations so celebrated among
astrologers. I have noticed its tranquil state either when there are
none or few such aspects, or when they are transitory and of short
duration.&rdquo; Had Kepler been able to examine these hasty and
erroneous deductions by long continued observation, he would soon have
found that the coincidence which he did observe was merely accidental,
and he would have cheerfully acknowledged it. Speculations of this kind,
however, are, from their very nature, less subject to a rigorous
scrutiny; and a long series of observations is necessary either to
establish or to overturn them. The industry of modern observers has now
supplied this defect, and there is no point in science more certain than
that the sun, moon, and planets do not exercise any influence on the
general state of our atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
The philosophers in Kepler&rsquo;s day, who had studied the phenomena of
the tides, without having any idea of their cause, and who observed that
they were clearly related to the daily motions of the two great
luminaries, may be excused for the extravagance of their belief in
supposing that the planets exercised other influences over
&ldquo;sublunary nature.&rdquo; Although Kepler, in his Commentaries on
Mars, had considered it probable that the waters of our ocean are
attracted by the moon, as iron is by a loadstone, yet this opinion seems
to have been a very transient one, as he long afterwards, in his System
of Harmonies, stated his firm belief that the earth is an enormous
living animal, and enumerates even the analogies between its habits and
those of known animated beings. He considered the tides as waves
produced by the spouting out of water through its gills, and he explains
their relation to the solar and lunar motions by supposing that the
terrene monster has, like other animals, its daily and nightly
alternations of sleeping and waking.</p>

<p>From the consideration of Kepler&rsquo;s astrological opinions, it is an
agreeable transition to proceed to the examination of his high merits as
an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
astronomer and a philosopher. As an experimental philosopher, or as an
astronomical observer, Kepler does not lay claim to our admiration. He
himself acknowledges, &ldquo;that for observations his sight was dull,
and for mechanical operations his hand was awkward.&rdquo; He suffered
much from weak eyes, and the delicacy of his constitution did not permit
him to expose himself to the night air. Notwithstanding these
hindrances, however, he added several observations to those of Tycho,
which he made with two instruments that were presented to him by his
friend Hoffman, the President of the States of Styria. These instruments
were an iron sextant, 2&frac12; feet in diameter, and a brass azimuthal
quadrant 3&frac12; feet in diameter, both of which were divided into
single minutes of a degree. They were very seldom used, and we must
regard the circumstances which disqualified Kepler for an observer, as
highly favourable to the developement of those great powers which he
directed with undivided energy to physical astronomy.</p>

<p>Even if Kepler had never turned his attention to the heavens, his
optical labours would have given him a high rank among the original
inquirers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of his age; but when we consider him also as the discoverer of the three
great laws which bear his name, we must assign him a rank next to that
of Newton. The history of science does not present us with any
discoveries more truly original, or which required for their
establishment a more powerful and vigorous mind. The speculations of his
predecessors afforded him no assistance. From the cumbrous machinery
adopted by Copernicus, Kepler passed, at one step, to an elliptical
orbit, with the sun in one of its foci, and from that moment astronomy
became a demonstrative science. The splendid discoveries of Newton
sprung immediately from those of Kepler, and completed the great chain
of truths which constitute the laws of the planetary system. The
eccentricity and boldness of Kepler&rsquo;s powers form a striking
contrast with the calm intellect and the enduring patience of Newton.
The bright spark which the genius of the one elicited, was fostered by
the sagacity of the other into a steady and a permanent flame.</p>

<p>Kepler has fortunately left behind him a full account of the methods by
which he arrived at his great discoveries. What other philosophers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
have studiously concealed, Kepler has openly avowed, and minutely
detailed; and we have no hesitation in considering these details as the
most valuable present that has ever been given to science, and as
deserving the careful study of all who seek to emulate his immortal
achievements. It has been asserted that Newton made his discoveries by
following a different method; but this is a mere assumption, as Newton
has never favoured the world with any account of the erroneous
speculations and the frequent failures which must have preceded his
ultimate success. Had Kepler done the same, by recording only the final
steps of his inquiries, his method of investigation would have obtained
the highest celebrity, and would have been held up to future ages as a
pattern for their imitation. But such was the candour of his mind, and
such his inordinate love of truth, that he not only recorded his wildest
fancies, but emblazoned even his greatest errors. If Newton had indulged
us with the same insight into his physical inquiries, we should have
witnessed the same processes which were employed by Kepler, modified
only by the different characters and intensities of their imaginative
powers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
When Kepler directed his mind to the discovery of a general principle,
he set distinctly before him, and never once lost sight of, the explicit
object of his search. His imagination, now unreined, indulged itself in
the creation and invention of various hypotheses. The most plausible, or
perhaps the most fascinating, of these was then submitted to a rigorous
scrutiny; and the moment it was found to be incompatible with the
results of observation and experiment, it was willingly abandoned, and
another hypothesis submitted to the same severe ordeal. By thus
gradually excluding erroneous views and assumptions, Kepler not only
made a decided approximation to the object of his pursuit, but in the
trials to which his opinions were submitted, and in the observations or
experiments which they called forth, he discovered new facts and arrived
at new views which directed his subsequent inquiries. By pursuing this
method, he succeeded in his most difficult researches, and discovered
those beautiful and profound laws which have been the admiration of
succeeding ages. In tracing the route which he followed, it is easy for
those who live under the light of modern science to say that his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
fancies were often wild, and his labour often wasted; but, in judging of
Kepler&rsquo;s methods, we ought to place ourselves in his times, and
invest ourselves with the opinions and the knowledge of his
contemporaries.</p>

<p>In the infancy of a science there is no speculation so absurd as not to
merit examination. The most remote and fanciful explanations of facts
have often been found the true ones; and opinions which have in one
century been objects of ridicule, have in the next been admitted among
the elements of our knowledge. The physical world teems with wonders,
and the various forms of matter exhibit to us properties and relations
far more extraordinary than the wildest fancy could have conceived.
Human reason stands appalled before this magnificent display of creative
power, and they who have drunk deepest of its wisdom will be the least
disposed to limit the excursions of physical speculation.</p>

<p>The influence of the imagination as an instrument of research, has, we
think, been much overlooked by those who have ventured to give laws to
philosophy. This faculty is of the greatest value in physical inquiries.
If we use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
it as a guide, and confide in its indications, it will infallibly
deceive us; but if we employ it as an auxiliary, it will afford us the
most invaluable aid. Its operation is like that of the light troops
which are sent out to ascertain the strength and position of an enemy.
When the struggle commences, their services terminate; and it is by the
solid phalanx of the judgment that the battle must be fought and won.</p>

at what time, and by whom, coloured glasses were first introduced for
permitting the eye to look at the sun with impunity. Fabricius was
obviously quite ignorant of the use of coloured glasses. He observed the
sun when he was in the horizon, and when his brilliancy was impaired by
the interposition of thin clouds and floating vapours; and he advises
those who may repeat his observations to admit at first to the eye a
small portion of the sun&rsquo;s light, till it is gradually accustomed
to its full splendour. When the sun&rsquo;s altitude became
considerable, Fabricius gave up his observations, which he often
continued so long that he was scarcely able, for two days together, to
see objects with their usual distinctness. Fabricius speaks of observing
the sun by admitting his rays through a small <i>hole</i> into a dark room,
and receiving his image on paper; but he says nothing about a lens or a
telescope being applied to the hole; and he does not say that he saw the
spots of the sun in this way. Harriot also viewed the solar spots when
the sun was near the horizon, or was visible through &ldquo;thick layer
and thin cloudes,&rdquo; or through thin mist. On December 21, 1611, at
a quarter past 2 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, he observed the spots when the sky was perfectly
clear, but his &ldquo;sight was after dim for an houre.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Scheiner, in his &ldquo;Appelles post Tabulam,&rdquo; describes four
different ways of viewing the spots; one of which is by the
<i>interposition of blue or green glasses</i>. His first method was to
observe the sun near the horizon; the second was to view him through a
transparent cloud; the third was to look at him through his telescope
with a blue or a green glass of a proper thickness, and plane on both
sides, or to use a thin blue glass when the sun was covered with a thin
vapour or cloud; and the fourth method was to begin and observe the sun
at his margin, till the eye gradually reached the middle of his disc.</p></div>
